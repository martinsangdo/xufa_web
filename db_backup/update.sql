The executives of Elemential know that headache well, and as such, are using their company to simplify the process of building <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-distributed-ledger/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">enterprise blockchains</a>.</p>\n<p>To do this Elemential, which is based in Mumbai, India, seeks to remove the pain of \"blockchain administration\" - which translates into the many hours every week that developers must spend on things like node deployment and configuration and maintenance activities, such as ensuring run-time and language dependencies.</p>\n<p>These are all things the firm\'s executives, CEO Raunaq Vaisoha and chief technology officer Anil Dukkipatty, dealt with during their first three years working with blockchain, first using \"colored coins\" (an early protocol that ran on top of bitcoin) and later with enterprise solutions like Hyperledger and Tendermint.</p>\n<p>\"When we started looking at blockchains, whenever we tried to take an application to production things would always go wrong,\" Vaisoha recalled, adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"As developers trying to build business value on top of blockchain, we had to spend way too much of our time actually worrying about the risk and actually automating stuff at the protocol levels.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>But the process of automating these processes is tricky on a blockchain since there\'s no single administrator. So the team at Elemential put together a node-level software called Hadron and a decentralized protocol for administrative communication and decision-making called the Federated Network Protocol (FNP).</p>\n<p>\"What we are trying to solve here is the logistics of decentralised decision making for large-scale enterprise networks,\" Vaisoha said.</p>\n<p>And according to several high-profile investors, including Matrix Partners, Lightspeed India Partners and Digital Currency Group (among others), who recently put a combined $1 million into the company, the project is exactly what the industry needs.</p>\n<h2>Blockchain \'hall monitor\'</h2>\n<p>Administration <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/private-blockchains-bitcoin-maximalists/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">on private blockchains</a> has proven to be a challenging problem.</p>\n<p>This is because many tasks, such as allowing another member to join or leave the network, will need to be executed in a coordinated manner.</p>\n<p>For example, if a new member has to be added everyone on the network will have to whitelist the new member\'s IP, open certain ports and make changes to configuration files like the genesis file, Vaisoha said.</p>\n<p>In such a scenario, it\'s much more efficient and reliable to automate these tasks - just what FNP is designed to do.</p>\n<p>\"Coordinating a decision on important activities such as adding or removing network members, network topology design [and] scaling up the network requires federated as opposed to a centralized method of decision making,\" Vaisoha said.</p>\n<p>As such, the FNP essentially acts like \"a hall monitor\" to ensure nodes are behaving, he continued. If a validator node is about to crash, for example, a so-called \"predictive correction feature\" kicks in.</p>\n<p>The Federated Network Protocol is aware of the number of validators, and their health, at all times. This awareness allows Hadron to predict the point of failure on the network and prevent it by spinning up temporary validators that keep the network alive while participants are alerted to the imbalance and instructed to remedy it.</p>\n<p>In this way, Dukkipatty said, the blockchains that use Elemential (which has designed its middleware for <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/hyperledger-tech-heats-ahead-blockchain-software-debuts/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Hyperledger Fabric</a>, Corda, Tendermint and private instances of ethereum) can continue working even <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/can-trust-based-private-blockchains-be-trusted/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">when a problem arises</a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/india-stock-exchange-blockchain-kyc/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Elemential is working with</a> the National Stock Exchange of India on a know-your-customer (KYC ) compliance scheme that\'s built on a private blockchain. The pilot includes ICICI Bank, IDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, IndusInd Bank and RBL Bank, as well as HDFC Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage.</p>\n<h2>More to come</h2>\n<p>While the system allows nodes on the same networks to communicate with each other, Elemential\'s aspirations go further than that.</p>\n<p>For one, the company would like to create a solution that works across private blockchains so that one organization using Hyperledger Fabric could connect to another organization running Hyperledger Sawtooth.</p>\n<p>And after that, Elemential is interested in even expanding its work to public blockchains.</p>\n<p>Ironically, since public blockchains are typically seen as less manageable than private ones, though, Vaisoha said public blockchains are easier to develop administration for since their networks are completely open, allowing anyone to glean configuration data.</p>\n<p>The main goal, Dukkipatty said, is to make managing a blockchain network a risk-free and seamless one-click experience.</p>\n<p>This is why Elemential calls itself the \"WordPress of blockchain,\" since - like WordPress did to blogging (increasing the ease of creating blogs which led to an explosion from 40 million in 2003 to more than 1 billion today) - Elemential plans to do for blockchain development.</p>\n<p>Dukkipatty concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"A lot of work has been done at the protocol level, but now it\'s about time that people start building applications - and we can see what\'s holding them back.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/old-mechanical-electronic-watch-on-light-13109740\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Watches</a> image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n', '<p>Elemential, which is based in Mumbai, India, seeks to remove the pain of “blockchain administration.&#8221;</p>\n', 0, '325906', 'https://www.coindesk.com/wordpress-blockchain-startup-seeks-solve-enterprise-pain-points/', '2018-04-23 01:14:55', 1),

The lesser-known cryptocurrencies like populous are leading the cryptomarket rally.</p>\n<p>EOS is now the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, courtesy of the 106 percent price rise from April 1 low. Litecoin has dropped to number 6. Meanwhile, bitcoin ranks fourth from the last, despite having rallied 34 percent since April 1.</p>\n<p>BTC\'s underperformance could be an indication the cryptocurrency is fueling the rise in the altcoins. Moreover, most altcoins are traded against BTC. So, investors pouring money into crypto markets tend to buy BTC first and then rotate the money into altcoins. The recent drop in the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bull-trap-not-says-lesser-known-price-indicator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">bitcoin dominance rate</a> from 45.62 percent to 37.98 percent (today\'s low) also seems to suggest so.</p>\n<p>History shows the altcoins surge happens after BTC reaches dizzy heights. For instance, BTC rally looked overdone in December and was followed by a rotation of money into cheap altcoins in late December and early January.</p>\n<p>However, this time, the alternative cryptocurrencies have outshone bitcoin at a time when the crypto market leader is recovering from a three-month sell-off. This indicates growing confidence in the alternative currencies and also adds credence to the argument the crypto market has bottomed out.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the crypto markets could remain solidly bid as the world\'s largest cryptocurrency has witnessed a major bullish breakout.</p>\n<h3>Bitcoin daily chart</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-327138\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"971\" height=\"439\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download.png 971w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-768x347.png 768w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-205x93.png 205w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-728x329.png 728w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-90x41.png 90w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-136x61.png 136w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-348x157.png 348w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-332x150.png 332w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-350x158.png 350w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-419x189.png 419w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-270x122.png 270w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-438x198.png 438w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-282x127.png 282w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-206x93.png 206w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px\" /><noscript><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-327138\" src=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"971\" height=\"439\" srcset=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download.png 971w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-768x347.png 768w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-205x93.png 205w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-728x329.png 728w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-90x41.png 90w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-136x61.png 136w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-348x157.png 348w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-332x150.png 332w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-350x158.png 350w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-419x189.png 419w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-270x122.png 270w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-438x198.png 438w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-282x127.png 282w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/download-206x93.png 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p>The above <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">chart</a> (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The long-term descending trendline has been breached in a convincing manner, signaling a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.</li>\n<li>The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup.</li>\n<li>The 200-day MA resistance is lined up at $9,737.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>View</h3>\n<p>Despite the pullback from $9,060, the outlook remains bullish.

From the standpoint of this small state with a population under 1 million, corporate franchise taxes are a vital source of revenue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In recent years, other states have heightened their efforts to attract out-of-state businesses and to erode Delaware\'s franchise, and while recently enacted tax reform should essentially halt so-called corporate inversion to lower tax jurisdictions outside the U.S., Delaware has lost untold millions in franchise taxes as a result of this practice. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another transformative change is underway that could in the not-too-distant future negatively impact Delaware\'s popularity as a jurisdiction of choice.  This change is not related to lower taxes, but to the popularity of blockchain companies that raise capital through the issuance of tokens or coins, often referred to as initial coin offerings (ICOs), and, relatedly, to so-called \"smart securities\" or blockchain-based securities with smart contract functionality issued by non-blockchain companies.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain issuers raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 through ICOs and, while these transactions varied widely in their quality (and compliance with securities laws), the popularity of ICOs has persisted into 2018 despite well-publicized scams, declining cryptocurrency prices, enforcement actions and strong cautionary pronouncements by the SEC and other regulators. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As evidenced by Telegram\'s $850 million follow-on offering of purchase agreements for cryptocurrency earlier this month, the market appetite for tokens remains voracious, at least episodically. Given the continued development of public blockchain use cases and that tokens are the fuel of public blockchains, we expect interest in token offerings to persist.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike shares of stock, tokens or coins generally do not confer ownership in any company and may not include security-like features at all.  Token holders are </span><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ico-governance-deficit/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not owed fiduciary duties</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the board of directors (or anyone else). Rather, the tokens confer something akin to a license or a coupon, that gives the token holder the right to use the company\'s blockchain platform and/or service, which may or may not exist at the time that the token is issued. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, the FileCoin ICO, one of the largest on record, confers a future right to digital storage. </span></p>\n<h2>New competition</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why should Delaware care about ICOs and tokens?  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the space matures and grows in legitimacy, we expect that more and more innovative companies (both start-ups and well-established) will choose to issue tokens or smart securities. For these companies, the appeal of Delaware\'s brand of expertise that focuses on shareholder rights in traditional business frameworks could wane, particularly as other states, such as Wyoming and Nevada, actively vie to become the go-to states for blockchain companies and technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new breed of blockchain entrepreneurs as well as traditional companies deploying blockchain technology to issue tokens can be expected to seek out other (token-friendly) jurisdictions that can provide clear regulatory guidance on the issuance of tokens and the rights of token holders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As time goes by, these companies and their corporate boards are likely to be attracted to jurisdictions that have built up a body of case law that specializes in blockchain, tokens and related issues, in much the same way that Delaware developed jurisprudence in issues related to fiduciary duties and corporate governance, with the potential end result of Delaware being left behind in this rapidly growing sector.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not to say that the blockchain boom poses an existential threat to Delaware\'s formidable corporate franchise. But Delaware\'s primacy should not be taken for granted.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is perhaps instructive that up until the early part of the twentieth century, New Jersey dominated corporate formations. But then-Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey waged a campaign to curry favor with the populist faction in his bid for president. This campaign included anti-corporation rhetoric and the passage of antitrust legislation, leading to a mass exodus of New Jersey corporations.  The exodus was a boon for Delaware, one which Delaware has nurtured over the last 100 years. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To the credit of its leadership, in August 2017, the State of Delaware was the first in the nation (and in the world) to enact legislation expressly authorizing corporations to maintain their corporate shares in a stock ledger on a blockchain. Since that time, several other states have introduced blockchain legislation relating to incorporations, tokens, transacting business, and much more.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact the State of Wyoming recently passed several pieces of legislation that not only copied Delaware\'s blockchain amendments but went a step further by </span><a href=\"https://media.consensys.net/wyoming-passes-5-pro-blockchain-laws-points-the-way-in-digital-asset-regulation-6fae9e07d129\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">providing guidance</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on how blockchain companies that issue tokens can do business in the State compliantly.</span></p>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State of Delaware is currently making thoughtful efforts to facilitate the use of blockchain technology so companies can file UCC financing statements and issue shares directly on a blockchain.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are important initial steps, and certainly the State should proceed with care. But in order to maintain a leadership position in the blockchain space, more will be needed in the not-too-distant future.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In particular, Delaware could benefit by, and should seriously consider, providing additional guidance around the issuance of tokens and cryptocurrency (including by being receptive to new legislation, if appropriate), and by leveraging the state\'s refined body of business law and expert judiciary to attract responsible blockchain projects; indeed, the industry would stand to benefit from Delaware\'s unique brand of expertise regarding governance.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we have seen anything in the blockchain space it is that blockchain companies will need a strong governance regime if they are to succeed both individually and as a sector. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Delaware can help with that.</span></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/sandwich-on-wooden-table-1064548337?src=158eRXE-1C311DSjrVYKnQ-2-65\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Sandwich</a> image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n', '<p>Delaware&#8217;s status as a go-to jurisdiction for business can&#8217;t be taken for granted as tokens take off and issuers flock to blockchain-friendly states.</p>\n', 0, '323638', 'https://www.coindesk.com/icos-eat-delawares-lunch/', '2018-04-23 01:15:07', 1),

R. Martin\'s books) calling itself Ravencoin. (Ravens have long been used as a symbol of prophecy and the Ravencoin project\'s <a href=\"https://ravencoin.org/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">website specifically calls</a> out the Game of Thrones reference to the bird as messengers of truth, which parallel the concept of blockchains as a technology for ultimate truth.)</p>\n<p>And lastly, a crypto entrepreneur and veteran of the trade in URLs or domain names, Joshua Metnick, pointed to <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/neo-ico-token-wins-traders-china-worries-fade/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Neo</a> as a power name. Sometimes called the \"etheruem of China,\" the Neo team rebranded from Antshares in June, taking on the name of the protagonist in the super popular Matrix trilogy.</p>\n<p>Looking at their CoinMarketCap chart, it would be hard to argue the switch didn\'t have an impact on the coin\'s price. The protocol\'s token shot up in value right afterward, from $1, and has remained around $65.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the interest is using monikers that are well-known throughout nerd culture raises an important question: just how important are these names to the evolution of a crypto token?</p>\n<p>In conversation with CoinDesk, Metnick said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"There is a certain \'coolness\' or \'dope-ness\' level to coins that is important and should be thought through before launching a coin.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The many mithrils</h2>\n<p>In the case of mithril, several crypto entrepreneurs are all hoping that name pays off.</p>\n<p>The first, Jeffrey Huang, also known as the father of Taiwanese hip-hop, is a blockchain-based competitor to services like Instagram and Snapchat, aiming to reward content creators for their posts and in turn, make the app popular through what it calls \"social mining.\"</p>\n<p>After the project raised 26,000 ether in a private sale of 5,000 \"mithril\" tokens, the company launched an app, called Lit - available for Android and iOS - which together already have 10,000 daily active users.</p>\n<p>Speaking to his choice of the token name, Huang told CoinDesk he is a big fantasy and sci-fi fan, and although he originally considered \"uru,\" the stone used to make Thor\'s hammer, uru didn\'t sound as cool as mithril.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, another project <a href=\"https://www.mithrilore.io/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Mithril Ore</a> is built around the idea of ethereum\'s forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/fundamentally-vulnerable-ethereums-casper-tech-takes-criticism-curacao/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">proof-of-stake system</a>, Casper. The company will sell mithril ore tokens to buy ethereum that can be used to create a large stake, which the company believes will allow smaller investors to get involved in mining without needing to have mined for some time.</p>\n<p>Explaining why it choose the name, Laura Hopkins, the company\'s CEO told CoinDesk, \"Mithril is a rare, solid and near indestructible resource. It is precious and scarce. We have 500,000 tokens that will ever be minted and we only go to 2 decimals. Hence, we are strong, valuable, and rare - like mithril. Hence, \'Mithril Ore.\'\"</p>\n<p>As it happens, many rappers have also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ic5M6P9CLo\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">rhymed the praises</a> of this second mithril, as well.</p>\n<p>And the final project (which changed up the spelling a bit to hearken back to a material used to create armor and weapons in the fictional universe of the Final Fantasy video games) <a href=\"https://consensys.net/diligence/mythril.html\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Mythril</a>, isn\'t a token project, but instead, a security analysis tool maintained by etheruem startup Consensys.</p>\n<p>When asked about the name, Bernhard Mueller, the software\'s creator, said, \"I have been waiting for someone ask this.\"</p>\n<p>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"One can imagine the ethereum blockchain as a physical chain that has been reinforced with ether and is therefore indestructible by normal means. However, those who wield a weapon forged of Mythril have the power to undo the magical barrier and lay waste to the blockchain.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>As such, Mueller, who created it in an effort to eliminate the major vulnerabilities in ethereum smart contract code that have led to the loss of millions of dollars in ether, built Mythril to find the faults in smart contracts so that malicious actors won\'t be able to later.</p>\n<h2>What\'s in a name?</h2>\n<p>That said, one company already gave up on the name - pointing to the need to differentiate itself and eliminate confusion - <a href=\"https://mithrilcoin.io/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">rebranding from</a> Mithril Coin to Plactal.</p>\n<p>And the overlapping names could later explode into a mess of trademark wars and litigation, some of which we\'ve already seen in the crypto space.</p>\n<p>Looking back at the early days of the web, for instance, shows how important securing names can be.</p>\n<p>For example, two entrepreneurs acquired the domain \"MP3.com\" in 1997 and started posting new music there. At the time, people were searching ferociously for places to get mp3s, and while the entrepreneurs weren\'t the ones who invented the mp3, they were smart enough to see possibilities in that piece of digital real estate.</p>\n<p>The next year, they sold a 10 percent stake in the company for $45 million, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP3.com\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">according to Wikipedia</a>, and in 1999, it went public raising $370 million - a record IPO at the time.</p>\n<p>Then, in the pre-mobile days, a name could also be a strict claim to the territory. For instance, any name attached to a \".com\" dominated any other URL.</p>\n<p>Still, Metnick explained, there are ways to enforce trademarks. Using the U.S. as an example, he said that knowingly violating someone\'s trademark incurs exceptionally <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanham_Act\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">harsh damages</a>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a company has to enforce its trademark. If a trademark holder waits too long to enforce the use of a name for a product that conflicts with the own, the courts can decide to let them coexist, Metnick explained.</p>\n<p>For a cryptocurrency or crypto token, a name would be considered a \"trademark\" under the law of most western countries provided it\'s actually in circulation, because trademarks are established by use (not registration).</p>\n<p>\"I would be surprised if a lot of these coins were active and aware and enforcing these brands,\" Metnick said, adding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"There are only a finite supply of cool words like \'mithril.\' It\'s a decent supply, but it\'s not infinite.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Jeffrey Huang rap group </em></p>\n', '<p>A &#8216;Lord of the Rings&#8217; reference in several crypto projects illustrates a coming land grab on the finite amount of &#8220;cool&#8221; names. </p>\n', 0, '325942', 'https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rappers-ravens-and-lord-of-the-rings-in-crypto-dope-names-pay/', '2018-04-23 01:15:12', 1),

Bitcoin core (BTC) prices touched a high of $9,410 but prices have dipped to the $9,340 range since reaching that vantage point.

Out of all the 1,590 listed cryptocurrencies on Coinmarketcap, the cumulation of these assets have accumulated a market valuation of $422Bn USD. Bitcoin Core (BTC) markets have gained 14.4 percent over the last seven days but many other cryptocurrencies have seen much larger gains. In the top ten positions, some notable increases include EOS, as its markets spiked 53 percent over the past week, while IOTA jumped 31.9 percent. But Bitcoin (BCH) markets were the clear winner over the past seven days as BCH weekly prices have increased by 88.3 percent today.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin Cash Markets Climb Over 88% Over the Last Seven Days</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bitcoin cash market volume has quadrupled over the last three weeks as the currency now commands close to $2Bn in 24-hour trade volume. This has propelled BCH into the fourth position in overall trade volume compared to all 1,590 other digital assets. The top five exchanges swapping the most BCH today include Okex, Bitfinex, Upbit, Huobi, and Binance. Fiat volume for bitcoin cash trades continues to rise over the last 48-hours as BTC pairs only account for 35.8 percent of today’s BCH trades. This is followed by the U.S. dollar (27%), tether (USDT 19%), the Korean won (11.3%), and the euro (2.6%). Ethereum pairs represent 1.4 percent of today’s bitcoin cash trades as well. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_150833\" style=\"width: 1800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-150833 size-full\" title=\"Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Bring Bullish Gains This Spring\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS.jpg\" alt=\"Markets Update: Cryptocurrencies Bring Bullish Gains This Spring\" width=\"1800\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS.jpg 1800w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-300x133.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-768x341.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-1024x455.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-696x309.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-1392x619.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-1068x475.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CAPS-945x420.jpg 945w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>The top ten cryptocurrency positions on April 24, 2018. </strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BCH/USD Technical Indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at weekly, daily and the 4-hour charts show BCH bulls have been relentlessly charging without much exhaustion.

BTC markets have seen a daily volume increase of $8.8Bn and a $157Bn market capitalization. However many other digital currencies have seen much bigger gains and BTC dominance is down to the 37 percent threshold today. Ethereum (ETH) markets are doing considerably well this week and are up 35 percent over the last seven days. One ETH is averaging around $695 per coin during the April 24 trading sessions. The third largest cryptocurrency valuation held by ripple (XRP) has seen seven-day gains around 37 percent. The market value of XRP today is $0.91 cents and markets command a $1.2Bn 24-hour trade volume. The cryptocurrency EOS has taken over the fifth top market capitalization as its markets have increased significantly this week. One EOS is hovering around $13.42 per token today with a $1.9Bn daily trade volume. </span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Verdict: Crypto-Optimism is in the Air</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall cryptocurrency market participants are extremely pleased with the past week’s runups in value. However, some traders are still skeptical that we are out of the bear market range as there have been a lot of false positive rallies over the last four months. So far the verdict is many traders and digital asset enthusiasts are confident 2018 will be just as spectacular as last year.</span></p>\n<p><b><i>Where do you see the price of BCH and other digital assets headed from here?

Shortly after rumors began to circulate, MEW issued a tweet to confirm their veracity:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150764\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-15.30.30-1024x403.png\" alt=\"Myetherwallet Servers Are Hijacked in DNS Attack\" width=\"696\" height=\"274\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-15.30.30-1024x403.png 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-15.30.30-300x118.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-15.30.30-768x302.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-15.30.30-696x274.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-15.30.30.png 1048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first signs that something was wrong emanated from the Myetherwallet Reddit, where a user </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MyEtherWallet/comments/8ek0jj/think_i_got_scammedphishedhacked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">posted a thread</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> entitled “Think I got scammed/phished/hacked”.

While the Mycrypto team would not wish misfortune on any members of the ethereum community, there may have been a touch of schadenfreude evident in their willingness to frankly disclose the nature of the predicament MEW has found itself in, writing:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-150758\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto-1024x805.png\" alt=\"Myetherwallet Servers Are Hijacked in DNS Attack\" width=\"696\" height=\"547\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto-1024x805.png 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto-300x236.png 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto-768x604.png 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto-696x547.png 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto-534x420.png 534w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mycrypto.png 1040w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My crypto also wrote: “Lots of anti-phishing folks in the community and on our team are attempting to collect information about what happened to MEW, as well as attempting to get in touch with their team to assist in any way we can.

Ark is a leading crypto project that’s hot on the trail of blockchain’s Holy Grail, interoperability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nestled quietly at number 59 (by market cap) on the <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-cryptocurrencies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>top cryptocurrencies</strong> </a>list, Ark is – and I don’t put this lightly – one of the most ambitious projects out there. Ark is an all-in-one blockchain platform that, to quote their official website, “aims to create an entire ecosystem of linked chains and a virtual spider web of endless use cases that make ARK highly flexible, adaptable, and scalable.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Bitcoin, </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Ethereum</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Litecoin, etc. are the usual first stops for any new crypto investor, the fun really starts when you branch off from the more “popular” coins. This is the true bleeding edge. It&#8217;s more interesting here because bargain prices can still be found, and it’s also where some of the most aggressive stabs toward the vision of Web 3.0 are being made. In the current landscape, I see Ark as one of the most likely to take the decentralized baton and power through the next lap. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my view, Ark is shaping up to be one of the soundest solutions for blockchain interoperability in the space. Below I’ll lay out 5 aspects of the project that make me bullish on Ark’s future prospects.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Note: This is just an opinion. It is not meant to be financial advice and there is no substitute for doing your own research.</em><br />\n</span></p>\n<h2><b>Five Key Features of Ark</b></h2>\n<h3><b>Consensus</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.ark.io/dpos-and-ark-voting-explained-68596a171ca1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Ark&#8217;s Delegated Proof-of-Stake</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (DPoS) system doesn&#8217;t consume electricity with the Vegas strip-style appetite that Bitcoin does.</p>\n<p>(Side note, many Bitcoin advocates will argue that the energy needs of Bitcoin catalyze more renewable energy sources. However, as </span><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/blockchain-coal-power-plant-mining-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>circumstances have already shown</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, what’s more likely is that the energy demands of mining Bitcoin will create an incentive for more decommissioned coal plants to reopen.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of burning energy like there’s no tomorrow, Ark has taken a different path: one on which its holders vote for delegates, and it’s up to the top 51 delegates to validate blockchain transactions and maintain the blockchain. DPoS can be thought of as a representative democracy, with individual participants using their holdings in order to nominate delegates who then make decisions for the group. These delegates confirm blocks and receive rewards in the form of transaction fees and Ark payouts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DPoS protocol is arguably a much better alternative to Bitcoin or Ethereum’s <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/proof-of-work-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Proof-of-Work</strong></a> protocol in terms of efficiency and scalability. While Ethereum has slowly been moving towards a PoS protocol, Ark has already accomplished this. DPoS is also commonly said to help maintain the critical element of decentralization, and any blockchain that’s embracing an alternative, progressive consensus mechanism gets a positive check in my book.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Use Case(s)</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ark’s use case is undeniably useful and simple to understand. Instead of competing with the likes of Ethereum and NEO to be the back-end of back-ends, Ark is positioning itself to be the glue that connects everything. Marketer Jeremy Epstein was recently </span><a href=\"https://themerkle.com/marketing-genius-jeremy-epstein-to-advise-ark-on-community-awareness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>announced</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as an Ark advisor, and he wrote an </span><a href=\"https://www.neverstopmarketing.com/5-reasons-why-i-am-psyched-about-ark/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>article</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> outlining why he’s so excited about Ark. In it, he uses the scenario of Starbucks purchasing coffee from a supplier in South America as an illustration of Ark’s utility. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this example, there are numerous blockchains that could potentially be involved in the coffee buying process. A blockchain for a privacy token to issue payment to the South American vendor, Ethereum to execute the smart contract between buyer and seller, a supply chain blockchain system that tracks the product with RFID tags, and perhaps another blockchain if the shipping and trucking companies use different systems. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can end up involving many different currencies and chains – in short, a total jumble. Ark is building the capability to streamline this entire process down to a manageable level. It’s often said that Ark doesn’t have competition, only future partners – and in light of this example that statement starts to make sense. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By owning Ark you can easily interact (theoretically) with any blockchain. As the blockchain economy grows, so will the number of utility tokens and the convolution of smart contracts. Something like Ark is going to be a necessity to avoid holding 20 tokens while still having the ability to access the full functionality of blockchain tech. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Clever Tech</b></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8128\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.45.33-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.45.33-AM.png 477w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.45.33-AM-200x121.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.45.33-AM-370x224.png 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The above use case example is largely powered by “SmartBridges” that only need a bit of code to be embedded into an existing blockchain to function. But what happens if a blockchain doesn’t input the code? Does this mean it’s off limits? No, and this is where encoded listeners come in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Encoded listeners are nodes that function as extension cords between different blockchains. The encoded listener “listens” for compatible orders being sent and works as a relayer. Encoded listeners have a small reserve of tokens and complete the needed conversion or action for a small fee. This presents an opportunity for users to be rewarded and help the network at the same time. Win–win. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who wants to act as a medium to help the network can. This is an innovative idea, and although I may not understand encoded listeners on a deeply technical level, it’s not hard to recognize their utility in the broad sense. The first encoded listener was developed by ACES (Ark Contract Execution Services) and enabled Ark holders to use Ethereum smart contracts. A similar listener for Bitcoin </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@arkaces/development-of-the-ark-and-bitcoin-listeners-completed-13494d0d95c1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>was not far behind it</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ultimately, the idea is that encoded listeners will become more widely available, allowing users to interact with a range of blockchains. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’d like to explore things further, co-founder Mike Doty was recently interviewed by the </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheCryptoLark?lang=en\"><b>CryptoLark</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It’s an interesting conversation, and it digs deeper into Ark’s use case and technology.</span></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v8sRwMWoAr8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h3><b>Scalability</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Push-button blockchain deployment is another feature of Ark’s that I believe will set them apart. Push-button blockchains are Ark’s answer to ERC20 tokens, the key difference being that these are separate chains – not more weight for the main blockchain to support. This could be tremendously important in terms of scaling.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once live, this feature will make Ark “clone-able” with one click (and linked to Ark’s main chain, hence already SmartBridge-enabled). This makes it so that anyone, even someone without a technical background, can deploy a blockchain simply and quickly. All of this potentially allows for huge growth (not to mention it drives adoption through ease of use) while simultaneously allowing the Ark blockchain to continue running cheaply and efficiently. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the above-cited Jeremy Epstein: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, the protocol governance implements at 50 transactions per block and 6.25 transactions per second, but the tests show a huge potential upside to this for the future. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scaling is an exasperating problem for just about every blockchain project out there, and to know that Ark has a solid plan in place is reassuring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ark </span><a href=\"https://ark.io/roadmap\"><b>roadmap</b></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lists push-button blockchain deployment as 61% complete. Once finished, this could be one of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defining characteristics of Ark. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Community </b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One criterion you should always consider when </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/how-to-rate-digital-assets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>researching an investment</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the people surrounding the project. Obviously, that starts with the development </span><a href=\"https://ark.io/team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>team</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ark’s is headed up by a group of ex-Liskers who’ve built a smart, dedicated, and passionate team. The Ark team has developed a reputation for transparency and execution, they’re active on social media and GitHub, and they appear to be ahead of schedule (a true rarity in crypto). </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there’s also the community to consider. Here are a series of semi-rhetorical questions that can help you feel a community out: How big are their numbers? How engaged are they? Are the project’s supporters passionate? Are people hung up on price or is there a strong focus on progress and understanding the technology? How does the community treat newcomers?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My observation has been that the Ark community passes these tests with flying colors. Ark has a dedicated tribe of followers that are active on </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ArkEcosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Reddit</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Telegram, and Slack. Despite its biblical sounding name, the Ark community has managed to be a real presence without falling into the partisanship trap, giving off a culty vibe, or being overly zealous. The Ark community exemplifies some of the best elements of cryptocurrency culture, and, in my view, this is another positive indicator of where the project is heading. </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Future Is Bright For Ark</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are quite a few more reasons to be psyched about Ark than those I’ve mentioned here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Ark wallet gets rave reviews in terms of its functionality and usability. Ark has established a cooperative society, </span><a href=\"https://blog.ark.io/ark-creates-a-unique-business-entity-827c488c7fb8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>referred to as SCIC</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in France. This is the first of its kind in the EU and will give them a huge credibility boost. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ark will ultimately offer support for up to 18 coding languages, so developers won’t be hamstrung by things like Solidity. Ark is also building an “Interplanetary File System &amp; Database” that will (once complete) have the potential to compete with the likes of Civic and Dropbox. In sum, there are numerous exciting developments on the horizon. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But does all of the above make the Ark token itself a good investment? In my opinion, it does. But this statement must be viewed only after a number of caveats have been made. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, Ark isn’t without challenges. Ark has limited uses at this (early-stage) time; what they’re doing is highly ambitious, and it’s uncertain if they’ll truly deliver. It’s also unclear precisely what role the token will play and what it’s value will be going forward. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the ambitious nature of what Ark is attempting, it&#8217;s hard to come up with comparisons by which to analyze the price (both current and future). Ark will likely be used as an intermediary fee that will grease transactions in the future ecosystem, but the specifics of this fee have yet to be spelled out. Ark could also use a bit of work in the marketing department, as their brand presence leaves something to be desired. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All that said, if Ark manages to get anywhere close to their vision of being the “go to” solution for blockchain applications, it’s safe to assume the token value will increase significantly. During the heady days of January 2018, Ark’s price crested close to $10. It now sits at the comparatively low rate of $3.50 (at the time of writing).</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8127\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM.png 960w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM-200x119.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM-768x457.png 768w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM-600x357.png 600w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM-370x220.png 370w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-20-at-9.35.45-AM-760x452.png 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://onchainfx.com/asset/ark\"><b>current supply</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Ark sits at 102,013,282 and it has a low inflation rate that is set to decrease over time.

What started off as just an idea to create an expanded universe via movies that would echo the serialized format of comic books has developed into a pop culture phenomenon.</p>\n<p>18 movies and 10 years later, this idea will culminate in the release of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> on April 26, 2018. This much-anticipated movie is expected to break box office records and send the MCU fandom into a frenzy, if the response to the movie trailers is anything to go by. Their two <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZfuNTqbHE8\"><b>official</b></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwievZ1Tx-8\"><b>trailers</b></a> have amassed a combined 227 million views on YouTube.</p>\n<p>In celebration of this epic movie event, we thought it would be fun to transpose the world of the MCU onto the world of cryptocurrencies. So, here’s our completely subjective take on the Avengers, if they were cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h3><b>Tony Stark/Iron Man: Bitcoin</b></h3>\n<p>Rewind to May 2, 2008. A new superhero was hitting the big screen. By no means was this movie the first of its kind; we’ve seen the likes of Superman, Batman, and Spider-Man before.</p>\n<p>An Iron Man movie, not being as recognizable a name as the aforementioned superheroes, was a bit of a risk. There was little name recognition, and the audience would largely judge the movie on its own merits. Would the public respond well to what was arguably a second or even third-tier superhero?</p>\n<p>It did, to the tune over US$580 million in box office receipts. And thus, the MCU was born.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><small><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8071\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IronMan01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"207\" /></small></em><small>Oops. Just like us crypto-fans.</small></p>\n<p>Much like Iron Man, <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-bitcoin/\"><b>Bitcoin</b></a>, on hindsight, signalled a new era in digital currency. A whitepaper written in 2018 by an anonymous figure, Satoshi Nakamoto, detailed the mechanics of a new currency built on blockchain technology. By leveraging the advantages of blockchain –  trustlessness, decentralization, and immutability – Bitcoin addressed the deficiencies in the digital money that came before it.</p>\n<p>The elegant solution of marrying digital currency with blockchain caught the attention of early adopters who saw the potential power of such a solution. It took years for adoption to grow, but now Bitcoin is a market leader and an undeniably strong brand name in cryptocurrency and blockchain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8072\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/IronMan04.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"240\" /><small>BTC dominance currently stands at 38%, hollaaaaaa!</small></p>\n<p>It’s hard to imagine a cryptoworld without Bitcoin; in fact, today’s cryptoworld, with over $300 billion in value and more than 1,000 coins, arguably would not exist without Bitcoin paving the way. The same can be said about Iron Man and the MCU.</p>\n<h3><b>Steve Rogers/Captain America: Ethereum</b></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8074\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cap01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"499\" height=\"205\" /></p>\n<p>3 years after the first Iron Man movie came <i>Captain America: The First Avenger.</i> In the intervening years, other MCU movies like <i>Iron Man 2</i> and <i>Thor</i> were released but, looking back, the first Captain America movie was the next high-impact movie in the shared universe.</p>\n<p>Afterall, Cap is billed as the First Avenger, and if we didn’t care about him, the first Avengers movie wouldn’t have worked as well as it did.</p>\n<p>As Joshua Rivera of GQ Magazine put it, <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/captain-america-marvel-mvp\"><b>Captain America is the unlikely MVP</b></a> of the MCU. Here’s a character rooted in the 1940s whose outlook and moral compass is arguably outdated in our current world, yet it is those very qualities that make him so appealing.</p>\n<p>There’s something romantic and idealistic about Cap’s origins, which then becomes the basis of great cinematic tension in his later standalone movies <i>The Winter Soldier </i>and <i>Civil War, </i>where we see him grapple with the challenges of inhabiting our modern world.</p>\n<p>His presence adds nuance and interest to the MCU world, as he is a character that (in the words of Rivera) “allows storytellers to raise all manner of interesting questions about who we were and who we are, and the ways our perception of ourselves clash with the reality of how we&#8217;re perceived.”</p>\n<p>While Iron Man provides the flash (The tech! The quippy banter! The ego!), it can be said that Captain America provides a real-world substance that adds depth to the MCU. And that’s why Cap would be Ethereum.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><small><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8076\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cap03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" />Steve got &#8220;upsized&#8221; thanks to the super serum; just like blockchain use cases got &#8220;upsized&#8221;, thanks to Ethereum!</small></p>\n<p>The brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-ethereum/\"><b>Ethereum</b></a> came about because Buterin envisioned other use cases for blockchain beyond what Bitcoin is capable of. He released a <a href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper\"><b>whitepaper</b></a> in 2013 that proposed the development of an alternative platform that would allow for the development of <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/decentralized-applications-dapps/\"><b>decentralized applications</b></a>.</p>\n<p>According to Buterin’s proposal, the Ethereum blockchain would have “a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create “contracts&#8221;&#8221; – this led to the birth of the “smart contract,” self-enforcing code created on the blockchain that is the basis of many applications in the market today.</p>\n<p>While Bitcoin made digital currency a credible idea, Ethereum pushed the boundaries of cryptocurrency with the concept of “<a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-a-smart-contract/\"><b>smart contracts</b></a>.” Here was a new way to harness the incredible power of blockchain that would have potential use cases in so many industries.</p>\n<p>Ethereum introduced the idea of a blockchain platform that would host decentralized applications, and ultimately it led to the creation of similar projects such as NEO, Qtum, and Lisk.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8075\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Cap02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" /><small>Choose wisely! #TeamCap #TeamETH</small></p>\n<p>Like Bitcoin, it’s now inconceivable to think of cryptocurrency without thinking of Ethereum. Similarly, Cap is now such an integral part of the MCU that fans are bemoaning the <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/krystieyandoli/new-avengers-infinity-war-trailer-black-panther-iron-man\"><b>speculation that he is likely to die in </b><b><i>Infinity War</i></b></a>. (Don’t do it, Marvel! Sobz.)</p>\n<h3><b>Thor: Stellar</b></h3>\n<p>Ah, Thor. The big, blonde, brawny one who formerly had a magic hammer (RIP Mjolnir!). In the grand scheme of the MCU, Thor is there to introduce the audience to the massive scale of the galaxy within these movies. Through Thor, we know of the Nine Realms, including his home Asgard, and we get a better sense of the vastness of the MCU world.</p>\n<p>This knowledge that the shared universe involves more than just Earth (or Midgard, as it is known to the Asgardians) becomes more important as we delve deeper into the MCU. Afterall, our big bad in <i>Infinity War</i>, the one who has unified all the existing MCU characters in an epic bid to save the world, is Thanos – a powerful Titan warlord who rules in space and aims to collect all of the Infinity Stones.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8078\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thor04.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"220\" /></i><small>The Bifrost, which facilitates travel between realms. In my mind, this is what blockchain looks like.<br />\n</small></p>\n<p>In this light, we can view Thor as the character that expands the storytelling in breadth and depth, and connects us, the audience, to the greater galaxy.</p>\n<p>So why then is Thor akin to <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-are-stellar-lumens-xlm/\"><b>Stellar</b></a>? Well, Stellar’s aim is to “connect people, payment systems, and banks” and “achieve a more inclusive digital economy.” With Stellar, multi-currency transactions are made more accessible and simple. While Bitcoin exists as an alternative currency, Stellar wants to connect and integrate with the existing infrastructure in our financial system.</p>\n<p>Just as Thor acts as a link between Earth and the wider galaxy in the MCU, Stellar is potentially an important link between our current financial system and the emerging digital economy. Stellar could be the bridge that brings more businesses and people into the blockchain world.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8079\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thor03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"270\" /></p>\n<p>It’s also a lovely coincidence that <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/stellar-lightning-network/\"><b>Stellar will have Lightning</b></a> (Network) on its side come December 2018.</p>\n<h3><b>Bruce Banner/Hulk: Cardano</b></h3>\n<p>Do you remember 2008’s <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>? While it is technically canon in the MCU, it doesn’t really feel like a fully fledged part of the cinematic universe.</p>\n<p>The role was (perhaps thankfully?) recast and Mark Ruffalo’s engaging turn as Bruce Banner/Hulk in <i>The Avengers</i> was enough to get movie-goers rooting for him. Together with Tony Stark, Banner become the other half of the “Science Bros” when both characters put their not-inconsiderable intellects together to try and figure out what the Tesseract was and what it was capable of.</p>\n<p>The duality of the character, Banner’s smarts and the Hulk’s brawn, plus Ruffalo’s everyman quality, makes this character interesting and dynamic to watch.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8080\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hulk01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"446\" height=\"250\" /></i><small>Science is cool! Bet the Science Bros are into crypto too&#8230;</small></p>\n<p>Banner’s intellectual prowess could equate to Cardano in the cryptoworld. Out of all the blockchain projects that exist today, Cardano has the distinction of being one that is <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-cardano/\"><b>driven by a scientific philosophy</b></a> and a research-first approach.</p>\n<p>With a team populated with leading academics and engineers, Cardano aims to create a decentralized platform for financial payments that balances both the needs of users and regulators.</p>\n<p>Of course, Cardano isn’t the only project operating in the digital finance space, but their academic rigor could set them apart from their competitors. The Cardano blockchain boasts its own Proof-of-Stake algorithm, Ouroboros, which has its own scientifically-proven proof of security.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8081\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hulk02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"205\" /><i></i></p>\n<p>The project is still currently in its <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/cardano-roadmap-what-the-future-holds/\"><b>bootstrap phase</b></a>, but if it does succeed at its goals, Cardano could be a massive force to be reckoned with, just like the Hulk.</p>\n<h3><b>Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow: Monero</b></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8082\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BlackWidow03.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" /><br />\nShe may be a mere mortal compared to the other super-powered humans in the Avengers, but she still packs a punch. A product of the Soviet era, the Black Widow relies on her wits and skills to kick ass. She’s the classic super-spy, accomplishing her mission goals without the enemy even knowing she was there.</p>\n<p>Naturally, her counterpart in the cryptoworld would be a privacy coin. And our choice is Monero, arguably the most well-known privacy coin in today’s market, with a current market cap of over $4 billion.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/top-privacy-coins/\"><b>Privacy coins</b></a> often get a bad rep, as most people tend to associate them with shady use cases. But the reality is that the ability to conduct private transactions is important. On public blockchains, details of any and all transactions are available if anyone cares to check.</p>\n<p>The question is: do we, as users, want<i> all </i>our transactions to be broadcast publicly? Privacy coins thus fill this need for anonymous transactions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8083\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BlackWidow02.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"247\" /></i><small>Bucky, taking the hits just like our crypto portfolios in Q1 2018&#8230;<br />\n</small></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/invest-in-monero/\"><b>Monero </b></a>currently leads the pack of privacy coins, thanks to its features such as Ring Signatures, Ring Confidential Transactions, and stealth addresses. Like Black Widow, Monero handles “business” without broadcasting who, what, or why; it just gets the job done. It flies under the radar, but its supporters are fully on board with its stated goals.</p>\n<h3><b>Clint Barton/Hawkeye: Dash</b></h3>\n<p>Similar to Black Widow, we only get glimpses of Hawkeye’s backstory. We know him as a special agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. who has deadly aim with his arrows. His characterization takes an interesting turn in <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron</i> when we are introduced to his family and home life. He retires from the Avengers at the end of that movie, only to return at the behest of Cap in <i>Civil War</i>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8084\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hawkeye01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" /></i><small>If only we had the same accuracy when picking moonshot crypto projects to invest in!</small></p>\n<p>If Hawkeye were a cryptocurrency, he’d be <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-dash/\"><b>Dash</b></a>. Originally a privacy-focused coin, Dash has pivoted to concentrate on facilitating payments and encouraging mainstream adoption of crypto by aiming to be, essentially, a better version of Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>For instance, unlike Bitcoin, the Dash network relies on masternodes which allow for faster transaction times and features such as PrivateSend and InstantSend.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8085\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Hawkeye04.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n<p>Dash has its fair share of support, with a current market cap of over $3 billion. Yet <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/dash-progress/\"><b>development delays</b></a> on the road to their Evolution mainnet goals have plagued the team. Just like how Hawkeye’s conspicuous absence in the <i>Infinity War</i> trailers have raised questions about his role in the movie (if any!), it remains to be seen if Dash will pick up momentum. But we’re rooting for them both to run the race!</p>\n<h2><b>Honorable Mentions</b></h2>\n<p>It’s been reported that <i>Infinity War</i> clocks in at 2h 29min, and even with that much runtime, fans are still somewhat worried about how the Russo brothers have balanced the storylines and characterizations of all our beloved MCU characters. (But in the Russos, we trust!)</p>\n<p>Just like a movie, we too are restricted – this article would be 3 or 4 times longer if we tried to discuss each MCU character! Hence, we’ve only covered the original group of Avengers.</p>\n<p>That said, some correlations are perhaps too apt to ignore, so here are a few honorable mentions.</p>\n<h3><b>Loki: Ripple</b></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8086\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Loki01.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"250\" /></p>\n<p>As everyone’s favorite MCU villain, it seems only fitting that Loki would be Ripple. Like Loki, <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-ripple/\"><b>Ripple</b></a> seems to have its own dedicated fanbase while simultaneously dealing with criticisms over its philosophy and centralized nature compared to other similar projects.</p>\n<p>Such criticisms haven’t detracted from Ripple’s success; it maintains a strong hold in the market as the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. With a growing number of partnerships and institutional backers, it seems like Ripple is here to stay.</p>\n<p>And just like Loki’s contentious relationship with Thor, it’s interesting to watch the dynamics of <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/stellar-lumens-vs-ripple/\"><b>Ripple vs Stellar Lumens</b></a>.</p>\n<h3><b>Thanos: Governments</b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8087\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Thanos.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"532\" /></i><small>Nooooo, don’t hurt </small><small><s>Bitcoin </s>Tony!!!</small></p>\n<p>If the Avengers were cryptocurrencies, then naturally their greatest enemy would be governments under the guise of Thanos. Sure, the rise in crypto adoption and the bull run in December 2017 to January 2018 were encouraging signs for early adopters, but as the market grew so did scrutiny from governments worldwide.</p>\n<p>The FUD arising from government scrutiny is arguably one of the biggest factors affecting the growth of the cryptocurrency space today. Will governments <a href=\"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/cryptocurrency-regulation-2018-where-world-stands-right-now/\"><b>rule against crypto use</b></a> and stifle adoption? Will stricter regulations stop the inflow of money even to credible blockchain projects?</p>\n<p>That said, some believe that cryptocurrency will only grow from strength to strength with greater government oversight. Scam ICOs and projects that lack credibility and actual real-world use cases will wither under the gimlet eye of the authorities, leaving only solid projects that can truly leverage the benefits of blockchain to enrich our lives.</p>\n<p>Also, not a spoiler, but let’s be real: we don’t know <i>how</i> it will play out, but we can be fairly certain that the Avengers <i>will</i> beat Thanos. We should brace ourselves for some possible character death, but the good guys will prevail.</p>\n<h3><b>Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier: NEO </b><b><i>and</i></b><b> Sam Wilson/Falcon: EOS</b></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8088\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/BuckyFalcon.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p>If Cap is Ethereum, then his trusty comrades, the Winter Soldier and Falcon, would be the other top 2 platforms in the market: <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/neo-what-the-future-holds/\"><b>NEO</b></a> and <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/eos-q1-2018-news/\"><b>EOS</b></a>. Both are possible contenders as “Ethereum killers,” and could take the lead to become the leading blockchain platform, depending on how each of them develops their ecosystem and partnerships in the near future.</p>\n<p>In the MCU fandom, speculation is rife on <a href=\"https://geeks.media/who-could-replace-steve-rogers-as-captain-america-in-the-mcu\"><b>who could take over as Captain America</b></a> should Steve Rogers die in <i>Infinity War</i>. There is precedence in the comic books for either the Winter Soldier or Falcon to don the iconic shield, but for now most of us are hoping that all 3 characters make it through the battle with Thanos.</p>\n<h3><b>Kevin Feige (President of Marvel Studios): Satoshi Nakamoto</b></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong></a>, in developing Bitcoin, was bringing the idea of a peer-to-peer digital currency powered by digital signatures to reality. Instead of a trust-based system, he envisioned one rooted in cryptographic proof which would remove the need for an intermediary.</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\"><b>Bitcoin whitepaper</b></a> and initial code were well-received by experts in the field, it took some time for the project to gain more interest and attention. It was in 2011–2012 that Bitcoin started to achieve wider adoption, and it has only gained more and more momentum since then.</p>\n<p>As crypto enthusiasts, we believe that the key tenets of blockchain and its applications will change the world – it’s just a matter of when and how.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8089\" style=\"width: 512px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/gageskidmore/\"><img class=\"wp-image-8089 size-full\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/KevinFeige.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/KevinFeige.jpg 512w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/KevinFeige-200x133.jpg 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/KevinFeige-370x246.jpg 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image by Gage Skidmore</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Driven by a vision of doing something that hasn’t been done before with comic book movies, Kevin Feige is indubitably the Satoshi Nakamoto of the MCU.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/marvel-cover-story\"><b>Vanity Fair</b></a> put it:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Feige’s innovative, comic-book-based approach to blockbuster moviemaking — having heroes from one film bleed into the next — has changed not only the way movies are made but also pop culture at large.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Similar to Bitcoin, 2012 was arguably a milestone year for Feige. It was the release of the first Avengers movie in May 2012 – 4 years after that first Iron Man movie – that heralded Feige’s success as the creative head of Marvel Studios. Throughout the Phase 1 movies of the MCU, the seeds for these heroes to come together were being sown, yet the success of the shared universe wasn’t a sure thing.</p>\n<p>Yes, the image of our Avengers Assembling was a potent one (if you didn’t feel your heart swell during <a href=\"https://dkang0316.deviantart.com/art/Avengers-Assemble-283549516\"><b><i>that</i></b><b> scene</b></a> when the camera circles around the Avengers in a half-destroyed New York City, you’re dead inside), but Feige didn’t squander the opportunity; <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-avengers-box-office-success-explained-2012-5/?IR=T\"><b>the movie lived up to the hype</b></a>.</p>\n<p>Belief in an overarching vision, a strong creative team, and a solid grasp of character and storytelling have been key factors in the success of Marvel Studios. And without Feige, the MCU as we know it today wouldn’t exist.</p>\n<h2><b>Final Thoughts</b></h2>\n<p>As anticipated and exciting <i>Infinity War </i>and its yet-unnamed sequel are, what’s even more thrilling is that Marvel Studios isn’t anywhere near done. They have a <a href=\"http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/marvel/237462/marvel-movies-release-date-schedule-calendar\"><b>slate of movies planned until 2022</b></a>, so although this first era of the Avengers seems to be coming to a close, there’s still more to look forward to.</p>\n<p>Blockchain and cryptocurrency are in the same boat. We’ve seen the market grow exponentially in the last 2 years, and even in the bear market in Q1 2018, a sense of discovery and excitement still permeated the space as projects launched, progressed and steadily implemented their goals.</p>\n<p>Regardless of its ups and downs (and it’s a rollercoaster, for sure!), there seems little doubt that we’re only at the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/blockchain-transform-industries/\"><b>blockchain revolution</b></a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i>We know we missed out many MCU characters, so which crypto would your fave Avenger be?

TRON plans to collate the data over the course of a week after which the airdrop token distribution will commence.</p>\n<p>The 30 million TRX tokens earmarked for the airdrop are currently valued at approximately $1.7 million. Each chosen account will receive a random TRX amount between 10 and 100 TRX.

He was <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/mt-goxs-ceo-mark-karpeles-arrested-in-japan-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arrested</a> by Japanese authorities in 2015 but was released on bail. Karpelès is required to remain in Japan under the terms of his bail.</p>\n<p>As a result, he will be working remotely from Japan. Ever since the Mt. Gox fiasco, he has become something akin to anathema within the crypto community. According to his own admission, he has had to juggle different jobs in diverse niches like online gaming, IP services, and network communications. The uncertainty over his legal situation certainly hasn’t helped the matter.</p>\n<p>The <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/powerful-forces-keep-mt-gox-heist-shrouded-mystery-alleges-bitcoin-entrepreneur/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mt.

Other Reddit users commented that not only would a fiat currency transaction that size be expensive, it would take days and that CPAs, attorneys and a sheer number of employees would also be involved.</p>\n<h2>Litecoin’s Low Transaction Fees and Fast Confirmation Times</h2>\n<p>According to <a title=\"\" href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/\" rel=\"\">CoinMarketCap</a>, Litecoin is the sixth most popular cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $8.5 billion. <a title=\"\" href=\"http://litecoin.org/\" rel=\"\">Litecoin</a> was created by software engineer Charlie Lee to tackle the scalability problems faced by the Bitcoin network.</p>\n<p>Although <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/can-bitcoin-be-both-a-payment-settlement-network-store-of-value/\" rel=\"\">Bitcoin</a> is a better store of value, Litecoin is more useful for payments. Litecoin generates a block every 2.5 minutes, whereas Bitcoin’s block generation time takes 10 minutes. Transactions on Litecoin’s network are therefore significantly faster than Bitcoin’s first generation blockchain network. Furthermore, Litecoin was also one of the first cryptocurrencies to implement SegWit to make transactions faster and cheaper. “We have all the cool scaling technology,” said Lee. “But the reason we adopted SegWit was not for the scaling features, but because it allows for instant payments off-chain.”</p>\n<p>As seen on <a title=\"\" href=\"https://bitinfocharts.com/litecoin/\" rel=\"\">BitInfoCharts</a>, as of April 22, 2018, it only costs a user on average $0.169 per transaction. The cost of sending a transaction peaked to $1.434 in December 2017.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin is Slow Compared to Other Altcoins</h2>\n<p>Unlike Litecoin, Bitcoin is significantly slower and more expensive. Although Bitcoin’s average transaction fee as of April 23, 2018, is $1.128, at its peak during December 2017, it reached $54.901. While it takes on average of nine minutes to confirm a transaction on April 24, 2018, earlier this year in January 2018, according to <a title=\"\" href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time\" rel=\"\">blockchain.info</a>, it took on average 2,536 minutes.</p>\n<p>In 2017, Bitcoin experienced many spikes in fees and confirmation times which eventually led to a split in the original blockchain. In August 2017, the Bitcoin blockchain hard forked into a Bitcoin spinoff known as <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/upcoming-bitcoin-cash-hard-fork-choices-for-bitcoiners/\" rel=\"\">Bitcoin Cash</a>.</p>\n<p>In comparison to Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash transactions are cheaper but take longer to confirm. The average transaction fee only costs $0.0508. Bitcoin Cash has also become a very popular altcoin ranking fourth on <a title=\"\" href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/\" rel=\"\">CoinMarketCap</a>. It’s also widely accepted at many common cryptocurrency exchanges like <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/coinbase-buys-bitcoin-startup-earn-com-for-120-million-hires-its-ceo-as-tech-chief/\" rel=\"\">Coinbase</a>, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/kraken-set-to-cease-cryptocurrency-trading-activities-in-japan/\" rel=\"\">Kraken</a>, and <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/the-largest-cryptocurrency-exchange-binance-is-facing-serious-regulatory-heat/\" rel=\"\">Binance</a>.

Lewis also notes that even if the original ad is disabled, similar ads pop up in a different guise.</p>\n<p>Facebook is currently in direct contact with Lewis’ team. While the social media network does not tolerate misleading ads, Lewis believes that Facebook should be more active and aware of their online responsibilities.</p>\n<p>“It’s time Facebook was made to take responsibility,” said Lewis in a <a title=\"\" href=\"https://blog.moneysavingexpert.com/2018/04/20/martin-lewis-to-sue-facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blog on his website</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“It claims to be a platform not a publisher &#8211; yet this isn’t just a post on a web forum, it is being paid to publish, promulgate, and promote what are often fraudulent enterprises.”</strong>\n</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Lewis’ Fight against the Social Media Giant</h3>\n<p>Lewis is known as Britain’s consumer rights expert, especially through his television show “The Martin Lewis Money Show.” <a title=\"\" href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/martin-lewis-sues-facebook-over-scam-bitcoin-adverts-2018-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">According</a> to <em>UK Business Insider</em>, online scammers are using Lewis’s popularity and reputation to trick retail investors. Lewis sees these <a title=\"\" href=\"https://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoin</a> and cloud trader “get-rich-quick-schemes” as “financially dangerous, [and a] near-certain money-loser.”</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these fake ads also appear as news stories on reputable websites such as the <em>BBC</em> and <em>The Metro</em> but link to fraudulent sites. “I don’t do adverts,” said Lewis on his blog.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“I’ve told Facebook that. Any ad with picture or name in is without my permission. I’ve asked it not to publish them, or at least to check their legitimacy with me before publishing. This shouldn’t be difficult.”</strong>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Lewis has taken this issue to court and is currently working with Seddons media lawyer Mark Lewis on the case.

Any damages will reportedly go towards anti-scam charities.</p>\n<p>Facebook has responded saying that they currently “do not allow adverts which are misleading or false on Facebook and have explained to Martin Lewis that he should report any adverts that infringe his rights and they will be removed.”</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“We are in direct contact with his team offering to help and promptly investigating their requests, and only last week confirmed that several adverts and accounts that violated our advertising policies had been taken down.”</strong>\n</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Dragon’s Den Stars Were also Involved in Online Bitcoin Scams</h3>\n<p>According to <em>UK’s Mirror</em>, a bitcoin scam also <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-scam-website-using-dragons-12350545\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">used</a> the images of the judges in Ireland’s <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006vq92\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dragon’s Den</a> to trick consumers.

The BitCoin Trader platform was, unfortunately, a scam and instead of the investment. The cybercriminals simply stole money and the consumers’ financial details.</p>\n<p>“The whole story actually reads very well if it wasn’t completely fake,” said Gavin Duffy to <em>RTE</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“I know it’s not true but I’d imagine if you’re somebody in the UK you could easily be duped by this.

TRON will airdrop 30M TRX (equivalent to approximately $1.7 million) to active user with a balance of over 1 ETH after January 1, 2018.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to the announcement, each account credited during the airdrop will receive between 10 and 100 TRX, with amounts selected randomly. The TRON team state that Ethereum played a “vital role” during the development of the TRON project, and want to provide TRX to the Ethereum community in order to allow users to experience their “high TPS development platform” as well as participate in TRON’s decentralized governance model.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-47069\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tronimage1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"579\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tronimage1.png 880w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tronimage1-300x197.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tronimage1-768x505.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px\" /></p>\n<p>Any wallet on the Ethereum blockchain that holds a balance of over 1 ETH and either transfer or receives ETH from block 4832686 to block 5471198 will be eligible for the airdrop.

This fact profoundly concerns Anaya, who states on his website:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mexico is also the country with the highest number of bribes among all the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Transparency International,&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Blockchain will allow us to rethink politics in the service of society</h2>\n<p>The concept of implementing blockchain technology to improve state governance models is extremely novel, considering that industrial implementation of DLT solutions is still at a nascent stage.</p>\n<p>In locations where blockchain technology is poorly understood — such as many Latin American towns — doubts and fears regarding its implementation are common due to a lack of information. This information scarcity leads to concern that a blockchain network can be &#8220;hacked&#8221; or that transactions can be lost. A lack of understanding regarding blockchain technology makes it difficult for many communities to see how it can improve the traditional procedures they are used to.</p>\n<p>As such, Anaya&#8217;s plans have given rise to debate, dividing people into fervent enthusiasts and tireless skeptics.In a <a href=\"https://www.ricardoanaya.com.mx/sala-de-prensa/presenta-ricardo-anaya-primeras-cuatro-propuestas-para-combatir-la-corrupcion\" rel=\"noopener\">press release</a>, Ricardo Anaya presented four proposals to combat corruption. Of these, two stand out for their visionary perspective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(&#8230;) To eliminate the use of cash at all three levels of government so that all payments are made through the financial system.</li>\n<li>(&#8230;.) To create a portable virtual platform that allows the permanent monitoring of public resources, in addition to incorporating blockchain technology, which will make it easier for citizens to know the allocation, use and destination of the resources it provides to the public treasury.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<figure id=\"attachment_43565\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-43565 size-medium\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vote-watcher-social-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"Using Blockchain to Bring Transparency to the Modern Electoral System\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vote-watcher-social-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vote-watcher-social-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vote-watcher-social-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/vote-watcher-social.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Related Story:</strong> <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/blockchain-transparency-electoral-system/\" rel=\"noopener\">Using Blockchain to Bring Transparency to the Modern Electoral System</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>These proposals are simply ideas that would require a robust, coordinated work of all public bodies to come to life.

Within the Latin American region, its potential is only now beginning to be exploited.

The rapidly changing landscape of the industry also makes it difficult for them to simply dive in without hesitation. Furthermore, given that cryptocurrency prices experience heavy swings in response to everything from <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-regulation/\">regulatory news</a> to trading volumes, it is becoming harder for even experienced <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/tag/trading/\">traders</a> to predict the direction of the market.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping this in mind, </span><a href=\"https://cryptics.tech/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Europe-based startup, is proposing to greatly simplify the market for all audiences, regardless of skill level, thanks to its advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptics’ main selling point is that it manages to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze data from across the cryptocurrency industry in real time. The platform is, therefore, able to provide a rather accurate forecast of cryptocurrency prices. The data used by the neural network includes both quantitative and non-quantitative sources, including current prices, social network sentiment and news.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, Cryptics has </span><a href=\"https://cryptics.tech/#mvp\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">already been providing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> daily forecasts of major cryptocurrencies on its website since October 2017. The company has explained that it wishes to demonstrate reliability and transparency of its main feature to potential clients and token holders. In its current state, the reliability of Cryptics’ forecasts ranges between 64 and 75 percent. Considering the self-learning ability of the neural network though, it is likely that the reliability will increase with time and a larger dataset.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to promote overall transparency and prevent a possible conflict of interest, the Cryptics team has also stated that it will not be creating its own investment fund. Other users of the platform will, however, be able to create and manage their own decentralized funds eventually. Ultimately, according to the </span><a href=\"https://cryptics.tech/Whitepaper-Cryptics-EN.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">white paper</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> released by Cryptics, it aims to primarily be an investment platform that also gives individual traders access to forecasts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through such funds, users that are not looking to micromanage their crypto assets themselves can allow another established trader to act as their portfolio manager. In such a scenario, the Cryptics platform not only allows users to sign up for such funds, but also gives access to the fund owner’s past profitability and risk profiles. This is an important consideration as not all people are necessarily comfortable investing in high risk, high reward scenarios or vice-versa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another Cryptics feature aimed at those looking for a hands-off approach comes in the form of the platform’s trading bots that will allow investors to automatically execute their trades depending on forecasts. These bots will also intelligently take each individual&#8217;s risk profile into consideration before actually executing a trade, giving users much more flexibility over their investments than ordinary trading programs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Cryptics platform will also have its own utility token, CRYPTICS, which will be available for purchase through an Initial Token Offering (ITO) sometime in the second quarter of 2018. The cost of each CRYPTICS token will be pegged at 0.001 ETH with a hard cap of sixty six million tokens set during the sale period.</span></p>\n', '<p>This is a sponsored story. CCN urges readers to conduct their own research with due diligence into the company, product or service mentioned in the content below.

It was through his experience there that he first understood that the future value of the microservices was going to be in Blockchain, implementing true decentralization. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thus, he got to work to create the Squeezer platform. His efforts have already started to bear fruit as the squeezer network is being downloaded @75,000 times per month by software developers from every corners of the globe.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Connect and Scale to Blockchains</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This early success has propelled Chisui to to further develop the Squeezer platform by enabling a robust blockchain connector focused on microservices.

The company operated a massive crypto mining complex on the outskirts of Tbilisi, the country’s capital. Such is the scale of Bitfury’s mining operation in Georgia that it has caused some controversy over its electricity consumption. Bitfury reportedly consumes an average of <a title=\"\" href=\"https://commersant.ge/index.php?view=post&amp;id=138889&amp;lang_id=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">28 million kilowatt-hours of electricity every month</a> for its mining operations. The use of electricity is estimated to be equivalent to the average consumption of 120,000 households in the country. Much of the controversy stems from the fact that despite these figures, the company pays a fraction of the usual electricity tariffs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Certain opposition politicians believe that Bitfury is being allowed to pay smaller electricity fees due to the alleged involvement of government officials in the company. Bitfury officials have categorically denied the existence of such<a title=\"\" href=\"http://cbw.ge/business/bitfury-group-used-no-preferences-privileges-georgia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> preferential treatment</a>, saying that the company is the victim of bad press.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apart from crypto mining, Bitfury has also partnered with the country’s government to develop blockchain technology solutions. In 2017, the company created a blockchain-powered database that could be used to secure public records. The company provided its server space as well as technical expertise for the project. A year earlier, the company also <a title=\"\" href=\"https://exonum.com/napr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">partnered</a> with the government to develop a <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/georgia-and-bitfury-together-land-in-hand/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blockchain-based land registry</a>. The company plans to create other registries for marriage certificates and various personal records in the country.</p>\n<h2>Libertarian Ideas</h2>\n<p>Mass crypto and blockchain adoption is turning the country into a breeding ground for libertarian ideas. Girchi, a small political faction in the country plans to create a state-owned cryptocurrency if it ever gained power. According to the party leader, Zurab Japaridze, this is part of the party’s goal to privatize the entire country. The party also uses cryptocurrency mining to raise funds for its activities. When visiting the party’s <a title=\"\" href=\"https://girchi.ge/ka/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">website</a>, the user is given a choice to allow his/her computer to be used for mining Monero. Speaking on the move, Japaridze says that the party has only made a few hundred dollars, but it has helped to establish itself among the younger voting bloc.</p>\n<h2>Exercising Caution</h2>\n<p>Just like in other countries, experts are urging citizens to be cautious when investing in the country’s crypto market. Most of the wealth being generated by the crypto boom in the country is for the benefit of people outside the country. Commenting on the issue, Mikheil Tutberidze, a Professor of Computer Science at Ilia State University in Georgia says that investors have to be wary of the “mass psychology” that causes massive buying during boom periods and panic selling during lean phases. According to the professor, taking out huge loans to invest in the market might end up in disaster.</p>\n', '<p>Georgia, a part of the defunct Soviet Union, is becoming a cryptocurrency hub.

Unsurprisingly, the publication’s plans &#8212; which you can read about in more detail <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610809/lets-destroy-bitcoin/\">here</a> &#8212; fall short of the mark.</p>\n<p>Author Morgan Peck presents three scenarios that could supposedly lead to Bitcoin’s demise.</p>\n<p>In the first, central banks use <a href=\"http://ccn.com/tag/dlt\">distributed ledger technology</a> (DLT) to issue their own digital currencies, shrinking the market for Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>But while many central banks are exploring how to digitize their national currencies, it is not outside the realm of possibility that the promulgation of state-backed digital currencies could increase demand for Bitcoin, which &#8212; unlike Fedcoin &#8212; is uncensorable, shows no respect for national borders, and has its monetary policy hardcoded into its software.</p>\n<p>At the very least, Bitcoin will likely continue to exist alongside Fedcoin, particularly once more privacy-centric features get added through <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/blockstream-acquires-bitcoin-wallet-greenaddress-sidechain/\">sidechains</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/lightning-strikes-again-as-lightning-network-software-notches-beta-release/\">Lightning Network</a>, or other future software upgrades.</p>\n<p>In a second instance, the digital economy evolves into a mass-barter system in which nearly every company issues its own cryptocurrency and a blockchain-based system trades them automatically when users need to make a purchase at a specific business whose tokens they do not own.</p>\n<p>What this scenario ignores, however, is that these company-specific tokens will require an underlying blockchain to secure them and facilitate bartering, and this blockchain would likely require its own native currency.</p>\n<p>Additionally, If the economy did evolve in this manner, it still seems likely that maintaining a reserve asset &#8212; whether Bitcoin or otherwise &#8212; would be more efficient for trading purposes, not to mention the fact that individual company tokens would become worthless if businesses shut down.</p>\n<p>Finally, MIT’s guide to taking down Bitcoin argues that Facebook or another social media conglomerate could wield its size and resources to co-opt Bitcoin and force users to adopt a forked version of the software &#8212; let’s call it Facebitcoin.</p>\n<p>However, it’s unclear what incentive Facebook would have to take this insidious route, as it would be much more expensive than creating its own token and distributing it through a multi-billion dollar initial coin offering (ICO), as <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/money-pit-telegram-ico-hits-1-7-billion-after-2nd-funding-round/\">Telegram</a> is currently doing.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this sequence of events appears to make the faulty assumption that Facebook &#8212; one of the world’s largest businesses &#8212; would add full support for Bitcoin but that this decision would not lead other companies to follow suit, reducing Facebook&#8217;s ability to exert outsized control over the coin.</p>\n<p>Mass adoption would ensure, and the Bitcoin price would skyrocket. In response, new miners would flock to the market, preventing Facebook &#8212; which would be at a significant economic disadvantage unless it begins manufacturing its own miners &#8212; from acquiring a large enough percentage of the Bitcoin hashrate to launch a meaningful assault on the network.</p>\n<p>Now, perhaps a corporate cabal could have more success, but even this is not certain. Though not an entirely analogous situation, the Bitcoin community only recently successfully resisted a hard fork &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/segwit2x-hard-fork-called-off-common-sense-delaying-inevitable/\">SegWit2x</a> &#8212; which had broad support among large industry businesses and miners (SegWit2x&#8217;s chief proponents ultimately called off the fork to avoid plunging the network into a civil war).</p>\n<p>Indeed, even in the unlikely scenario that this did occur, it&#8217;s difficult to imagine this cartel maintaining control over Bitcoin indefinitely, and the threat of a network split would provide a strong financial disincentive to wage such a corporate takeover.</p>\n<p>All things considered, it&#8217;s not outside the realm of possibility that malicious actors could attempt to <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/china-ico-ban-worlds-oldest-bitcoin-exchange-shuts-doors/\">take down Bitcoin</a>, but previous attempts have failed to amount to much. In short, users probably have nothing to worry about.</p>\n<p><em>Featured image from Shutterstock.</em></p>\n', '<p>“Let’s destroy Bitcoin.” Thus the MIT Technology Review purports to present a guide to taking down the flagship cryptocurrency, whose network has achieved 99.99 percent uptime since its launch in January 2009.

This solution demystifies <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.iota.org/\" rel=\"\">IOTA</a>’s potential to become the backbone of the Machine Economy. Thanks to ElaadNL’s cutting-edge innovation, seamless e-mobility is taking one big leap forward, and we look forward to sharing this achievement with the rest of our growing ecosystem, at the crossroads of mobility, energy, and smart cities sectors.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The charging station works independently, and unsupervised, where paying and charging is both done employing IOTA’s &#8220;blockless&#8221; distributed ledger technology, Tangle, on a Machine-to-machine (M2M) basis.</p>\n<p>The charging station is outfitted with hardware operation that is capable of setting up TCP/IP connection with the car. Once the connection is established, it will permit the exchange of relevant data and payment via IOTA in a machine-to-machine mode. Using the IOTA wallet, users can charge their car by sending IOTA tokens if the vehicle does not have the required software or hardware. </p>\n<p>Onoph Caron, Managing Director of ElaadNL, stated, “This charger shows the ability to use the real machine to machine communications and micropayments, with the use of IOTA as a secure layer for these payments and data. ElaadNL researches all kinds of innovative and smart technologies with regard to charging electric cars. DLT-technology might become a popular thing shortly. Now we can explore and research its possibilities on our testing ground in Arnhem.”</p>\n<h2><b>A Perfect Fit for the Future</b></h2>\n<p>IOTA tangle is actually a novel Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) which is mainly designed for the Internet of Things (IoT). It is an open source procedure to make easy novel M2M interactions comprising fee-less real-time micropayments and secure data transfer.</p>\n<p>The charging station does not require an additional communication protocol to smoothly run operations as transactions are exchanged straightaway without the utilization of a charge card. IOTA charging station functions entirely autonomously. To guarantee reliable and irrefutable administration meter values are stored in Tangle blockless <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/tag/distributed-ledger-technology/\" rel=\"\">distributed ledger technology</a> every 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Earlier in 2018, IOTA signed a partnership with <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/iotas-tangle-protocol-transform-taipei-smart-city/\" rel=\"\">Taipei</a> city to help the government achieve its smart city goals.

Linear regression is a simple, easy-to-use strategy that can be utilized to identify entry and exit points based on the price action of the cryptocurrency.</strong></p>\n<h2>What is a Linear Regression?</h2>\n<p>A <a title=\"\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">linear regression</a> is a mathematical method used to capture the determination of a specific variable. In our case, let’s say the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-price/\" rel=\"noopener\">price of bitcoin</a>. We want to know what factors determine the price of bitcoin. A linear regression can be modeled. Let’s call price of bitcoin in period t, yt, and use the price in the previous period as a determinant, yt-1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yt = byt-1 + e</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once we apply this model to the financial time series data, we will end up with estimates for the parameters b and e. The parameter b basically tell us the relationship between the past and current <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-price/\" rel=\"\">price of bitcoin</a>. The parameter e captures all other variables effect on price and is known as the residual.</p>\n<p>Of course, this model can be extended to include as many time periods as you like. We could go even further and add other variables if we wanted to. Using various diagnostics, we can assess the fit of the model to the data and forecast based on this model. For each time period, we would simply update the data, run the model again and produce a new forecast.</p>\n<p>HOwever, this is no crystal ball, and the purpose is not to obtain a point forecast. Instead, we obtain an estimate such that we can map out the possible underlying values based on the estimate we have made and accounting for standard errors, known as a confidence interval. As for the confidence interval, we can think of it visually as a normal distribution. Then we can say, we are 99, 95 or 90 percent certain that the price of bitcoin will be $X at a certain date.</p>\n<p>The middle of the shape above would be our estimate and provided we have good enough estimators, the true value of the relationship we are estimating will lie somewhere in the bell-shaped curve.</p>\n<h3>Return to the mean</h3>\n<p>Another interesting thing to note is that most financial time series data have a property known as a unit root. It basically means the variable exhibits a behavior known as mean reversion. To read more about mean reversion applied to <a title=\"\" href=\"http://litecoin.org/\" rel=\"\">litecoin</a>, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://coinmetrics.io/mean-reversion-and-reflexivity/\" rel=\"\">Coin Metrics’ post</a> observes this property for the altcoin&#8217;s Network Value to Transaction ratio.</p>\n<p>The weekly chart of bitcoin below shows 12 out of the past 89 weeks, BTC-USD has touched the middle line &#8211; the mean. And in the author’s opinion, looks to cross it again very soon, given that the price action is moved away from the -2 standard deviation (bottom line).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/kwl6SOBr/\" width=\"700\" height=\"436\" /></p>\n<p>We will see in the next section how mean reversion is relevant to the linear regression trading indicator.</p>\n<h2>Trading with Linear Regression</h2>\n<p>OK, so let’s apply what we have learned so far. We can visually represent a linear regression similar to the example outlined above on charts such as <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/\" rel=\"\">TradingView</a>. See below for the linear regression for <a title=\"\" href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" rel=\"\">bitcoin</a> on the daily timeframe.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/gKDvoTdr/\" width=\"702\" height=\"438\" /></p>\n<p>The author prefers to use <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/part-1-candlesticks-and-the-fibonacci-sequence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fibonacci</a> numbers and usually the 89 and 144 for long-term view on the weekly outlook, while you can also use lower numbers on lower timeframes for smaller trends. The higher, the better, since you capture more of the data available, but requires more patience to act upon. If you prefer zen trading, use higher period for the linear regression indicator, if you&#8217;re more of a scalper, use a lower period. </p>\n<p>In the chart above, we have used 89, so 89 periods are included in the regression sample to provide an estimate. The mean &#8211; or expected value &#8211; is displayed by the line in the middle.</p>\n<p>Now with TradingView, you will have to add &#8216;Linear Regression&#8217; as an indicator twice, and set one to +/-1 standard deviation and set the other to +/-2 standard deviation; this is basically our confidence interval we explained earlier. Now, for any period of time, we can determine whether the price is within the channel and in which zones are ‘extreme.’ Remember, most financial time series data have a property of mean reversion, and we can see this below. In 89 periods, the price has bobbed toward and away from the mean numerous times.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we can think of each of these lines displayed as supports/resistances. Once a support or resistance breaks, we should not fight against the market, but flow with it.</p>\n<p>As shown above, we can see clear sell signals in mid-February and early March, but a word of caution is here. At the time, the chart would have looked different so the main point here is that when the price approaches or even leaves the zone highlighted by the linear regression, we should consider selling/buying. For instance, we see that the price on March 4 closed above the zone highlighted by the indicator (and was also a <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hangingman.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hanging man</a> candlestick pattern), so indicating to sell.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, the price of bitcoin is again approaching the +2 standard deviation, suggesting we may look for a short position soon. However, the downtrend in bitcoin has been going on since December 2017, more than three months and the 89-period regression shows a downward trend. It could be that the price of bitcoin breaks out of the channel illustrated above, in which case we should revert to a different period for the regression or a different timeframe and best capture the shorter-term trend.</p>\n<p>For instance, say we believe the downward channel will be broken. We can draw a new linear regression on the chart by changing the timeframe in one of two ways; change the period or change the timeframe. The chart below changes from daily to 4-hour price action and where the channel indicates to sell is much higher as with the places to buy. By May 3, $10,000 is comfortably within the lower line, meaning that around this date, the psychological level is part of a support zone. Of course, this is assuming the current trend holds.</p>\n<p>Comparing with the previous chart (daily), it suggests that any move above $10,000 should be dumped on. However, when aligning the regression period with the newer upward trend, it paints a different picture with an estimate of $10,500 by May 3. In essence, we have to find the current structure of the market, monitor and eye our buy and sell zones. </p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/9xZnpnPq/\" width=\"698\" height=\"435\" /></p>\n<p>Linear regression is based on extrapolation &#8211; meaning it is based on the historical price action. It should be obvious that past patterns are not necessarily repeated in the future. This is one drawback of the linear regression method and highlights the importance of staying on top of fundamental and sentiment development of the asset in question to anticipate any change in the market’s structure.</p>\n<p>Great technical analysis is not a house that stands on one pillar. As with all trading indicators, using them on their own may give you some insight into the true behavior of markets, but you are more likely to succeed when combining synergistic indicators; for example, one based on price action, one based on momentum, one based on volume, etc. In the next section, we will show you what indicators work best with Linear Regression.</p>\n<h2>A Strategy Based on Linear Regression</h2>\n<p>Linear regression is an indication of price action. Therefore, we would like such additional indicators to enhance and confirm our signals. In the author’s opinion, momentum indicators like <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/cryptocurrency-investment-guide-momentum-rsi/\" rel=\"\">RSI</a>, MACD, Stochastics, or the Awesome Oscillator, <a title=\"\" href=\"http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:parabolic_sar\" rel=\"\">Parabolic SAR</a>, and volume are enough.</p>\n<h3>Momentum Indicators</h3>\n<p>Momentum indicators indicate oversold/overbought conditions and can act as a second call on the direction of the market in light of a signal given by the Linear regression method.  For instance, if the price is near the +2 standard deviation line and the RSI is nearing, or above 65, then we have confirmed the Linear Regression signal that the upward trend may be running out of steam soon. If, on the other hand, the price is near the +2 standard deviation line and the RSI is near 50, there may be some fuel left in the tank for an upward continuation.</p>\n<h3>Parabolic SAR</h3>\n<p>The Parabolic SAR is a very simple indicator which can only tell you one thing; when to enter/exit positions. It does nothing more than providing a signal saying &#8211; you need to buy (or sell) in this session! The Parabolic SAR is represented by a dot. Say it is above the price action, and then you observe it moves now to below the price action, we have a buy signal, and vice versa for a sell signal. Not only that, we must also look for the dots to become ‘parabolic’ to support the move in the asset.</p>\n<p>When combined with the Linear Regression indicator, both signals can help reinforce each other. While both can be used to provide an entry, Linear regression will be more useful in planning an exit.</p>\n<h3>Volume</h3>\n<p>Finally, volume is an important indicator that should be included in any <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/guide/trading-strategies/\" rel=\"\">trading strategy</a>. Volume precedes price action, meaning changes in volume are key in determining future trends of the price of a cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows how these pieces come together. At the time of writing, we should be long already since April 23, and we would look to exit when the price action reaches the +2 standard deviation, or the Parabolic SAR switches back above the price action. The price has been around the mean for some time, suggesting bitcoin could be propelled further upward.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/nUBjhDvT/\" width=\"699\" height=\"436\" /></p>\n<h3>Another Example</h3>\n<p>So the author was playing around with an example, AEON. On April 5, the market for AEON-BTC is illustrated below, and you see the price had already touched the -2 standard deviation, motivating an entry into a long position. The signal was confirmed later on by using the ‘record session’ method of counting lows (or highs) until 7-10 record sessions are observed.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AEON&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$AEON</a> in the &#39;Sleeping&#39; Alligator, means breakout will follow soon&#8230;<a href=\"https://t.co/mYXFE7Qhi3\">https://t.co/mYXFE7Qhi3</a><br />Weekly &#8211; Linear Regression also shows high likelihood of reversal <a href=\"https://t.co/yELT6AaMny\">pic.twitter.com/yELT6AaMny</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Jamie Holmes (@JamieHolmes1991) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamieHolmes1991/status/981893251484602368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 5, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>On April 24, we see that the signal has almost been delivered &#8211;  we are in week three of no new low &#8211; meaning the count will be restarted and bull trend taking hold. AEON-BTC also attempted to test the resistance at -1 standard deviation, suggesting we will move back to the mean and possible extend higher to the +1/+2 standard deviation over the long term.</p>\n<p>The chart below shows where you would exit from a long, and assumes we have already entered/about to enter a long.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.tradingview.com/x/5aja44UJ/\" width=\"697\" height=\"434\" /></p>\n<p>In part, it depends on the date. In the chart above, we see that 0.00037 is a good exit for late June 2018. Further along, in September/October, we can notice the +1 standard deviation provides resistance around the 0.00050 handle. Finally, another exit point could be near the 2018 high 0.00064 for early 2019.</p>\n<p>Of course, the trend could be broken and force the linear regression to have a smaller gradient (or an even higher one) so that the channel changes its direction, so these charts need to be monitored every week to adjust your exit positions or find new entries. For instance, a move above the -1 standard deviation line would prompt another long entry, as would a move above the mean. </p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>In summary, the linear regression is a trading indicator allowing you to time entries and exit on cryptocurrencies. It does not tell you anything about momentum or volume, so ensure you use it with indicators measuring these aspects of the market.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>To read the full series of &#8216;A Guide to Trading Cryptocurrency,&#8217; click <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/guide/trading-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</em></p>\n', '<p>To read Part 6 of BTCManager&#8217;s &#8216;A Guide to Trading Cryptocurrency,&#8217; click here.

Meanwhile, 22% provided a longer-term time horizon of the next six-to-12 months. Thomson Reuters polled more than 400 clients across its trading solutions Eikon, REDI and FX platforms.</p>\n<h2>The Ethereum Connection</h2>\n<p>Sam Chadwick, director of strategy and innovation at Thomson Reuters, specializes in the blockchain and took some time to talk with CCN from Zurich, Switzerland.</p>\n<p>In 2015, Chadwick was doing his postgraduate Masters at Oxford University. While searching for a dissertation topic, Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s paper on Ethereum just happened to come out. He read it and decided to write on the impact of the blockchain on financial services. As fate would have it, Vitalik was only a kilometer away in Switzerland, so Chadwick emailed him and they met up for a coffee at Starbucks. Chadwick says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had a chat for my dissertation on how Thomson Reuters would be impacted by the blockchain and smart contracts. [Buterin] said there would be some disruption of the client base you serve today if it pans out the way we think it will. But smart contracts needed some mechanism of getting off-chain data, like weather, temperature, interest rates and prices of other world assets. That became my thesis.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chadwick continues to lead blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation for Thomson Reuters from Zurich. The year after he joined, Thomson Reuters launched BlockOne IQ, which incidentally provides data for JPMorgan and National Bank of Canada&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/jpmorgan-tests-the-waters-for-blockchain-fueled-debt-issuance/\">debt issuance on Quorum</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Rise of Cryptocurrency Trading</h2>\n<p>In January 2017, prior to the more recent formal survey, Thomson Reuters&#8217; Chadwick anecdotally polled the firm&#8217;s institutional clients about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in response to which Chadwick said he was met with &#8220;blank stares.&#8221; By year-end 2017, however, when &#8220;bitcoin fever&#8221; hit, the tide turned. For instance, Thomson Reuters added bitcoin to its desktop platform Eikon as well as on its premium data feed for price discovery.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;That was one year ago. And then coming into the end of last year into Q4, prices of cryptocurrency assets went bananas. Bitcoin started soaring. That landing page we created for bitcoin inside Eikon moved up to be No. 2 of all the FX landing pages after the euro,&#8221; explained Chadwick.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/goldman-sachs-hires-crypto-trader-but-still-denies-its-launching-a-trading-desk/\">there&#8217;s speculation</a> that Goldman Sachs is launching a cryptocurrency trading desk, Chadwick wouldn&#8217;t comment on them or the clients that were surveyed given the sensitiveity of the topic, except to say: &#8220;It was a combination of the large buy-side organizations &#8212; asset managers and hedge funds &#8212; as well as some of the bank trading desks.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also described the number of ways in which financial institutions more broadly could potentially begin cryptocurrency trading. &#8220;Whether they invest in the capabilities, form partnerships or quietly white-label, we don&#8217;t know. But there are different ways they .. new product without too much heavy lifting,&#8221; said Chadwick.</p>\n<h2>Rise of the Altcoins?</h2>\n<p>Chadwick went on to describe the appetite among Thomson Reuters&#8217; clients for cryptocurrencies, which interestingly extends beyond just the top 10 digital currencies.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the questions on our survey was if we were to cover cryptocurrency pricing and trading, which ones would you be interested in? The big ones were named, but then it was interesting to see some of the altcoins that people picked. It drew me to think about whether players are thinking about creating fund offerings in which you&#8217;re not 100% to bitcoin or 50/50 bitcoin/Ethereum. But you could actually hold a portfolio of 10-20 coins that would diversify your risk given the fact that these are startups,&#8221; explained Chadwick.</p>\n<p>The financial institutions that were polled seemed less interested in the privacy coins like Zcash or Monero, which might not pass KYC checks, he explained.

Antpool has <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-23/bitcoin-cash-burning-claim-adds-fire-to-pr-battle-with-bitcoin\" rel=\"\">burned about $12 worth of bitcoin cash per day</a>. According to Kyle Samani, the managing partner at Multicoin, a U.S.-based crypto hedge fund firm, it is a ploy to make it seem like there is a reduced supply of bitcoin cash and purely a marketing move.</p>\n<p>However, it is important to remember that the overall cryptocurrency market is recovering, and the performance of BCH against other cryptoassets could be attributed to the upcoming hard fork in May, among other things.</p>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" rel=\"\">Bitcoin</a> developer Jimmy Song, as well as others, criticized the move, suggesting it goes against the monetary policy out of a rules-based approach that Satoshi Nakamoto outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Instead, Antpool is engaging in a very mild form of discretionary policy, although it is very slight. Nevertheless, it could set a precedent and may be leading to people forming expectations it may increase in the future:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IIRC, AntPool fees are now burned in BCH.

Bitcoin Cash due to its increased block size limit of 8MB offers lower transaction fees and faster transaction times.

Once deployed, Lightning Network has the potential to significantly reduce the perceived advantages that Bitcoin Cash holds over Bitcoin. This is according to Lucas Nuzzi, Director of Technology at Digital Asset Research, a crypto research lab based in the U.S. Nuzzi says that miners on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have to constantly liquidate their holdings in order to cover their recurring operational expenditure.</p>\n<p>A BitMex research <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/analysis-of-segwit-and-bitcoin-cash-transaction-volumes-segwit-is-leaving-bitcoin-cash-behind/\" rel=\"\">report</a> published in March 2018 showed that SegWit transactions on bitcoin have surpassed Bitcoin Cash.</p>\n<h2>No Clear Standard for Determining Crypto Quantity</h2>\n<p>It isn’t entirely clear what the actual ramifications of the Antpool coin burning will have on the value of Bitcoin Cash.

Without clear guidelines startups that do attempt to follow securities laws are at a distinct disadvantage over their competitors.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that the SEC is wholly opposed to the new way of raising money. What&#8217;s important is that investors are protected from unscrupulous actors. As said by SEC Chairman Jay Clayton:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;We seek to foster innovative and beneficial ways to raise capital, while ensuring – first and foremost – that investors and our markets are protected.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The DAO Investigation</h2>\n<p>Recently the SEC has asserted itself. In July of 2017 <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf\">enforcement actions</a> towards <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3082055\">The DAO</a> clarified the agency&#8217;s stance towards ICOs.</p>\n<p>The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was a novel, open-source, decentralized business model built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart-contracts. Unlike traditional businesses, The DAO had no conventional management structure or board of directors.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_46759\" style=\"width: 594px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" wp-image-46759\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-DAO.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"594\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-DAO.png 800w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-DAO-300x135.png 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-DAO-768x347.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A vulnerability in the DAO allowed hackers to siphon off a third of the funds contributed to The DAO. In response, the Ethereum Community decided to hard-fork Ethereum to restore funds back to the original holders.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the investigation, the SEC determined that The DAO violated federal securities laws with an unregistered offer when DAO Tokens were offered in exchange for Ethereum.</p>\n<h3>Although The DAO described the action as a &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2015/33-9974.pdf\">crowdfunding contract</a>&#8221; it did not meet the Regulation Crowdfunding exemptions to qualify as such. Pursuant to the regulation, The DAO did not register as a funding portal which in turn invoked SEC action.</h3>\n<p>This was one of the first major enforcement actions towards an ICO by the SEC. If an ICO is raising money, even if it&#8217;s in a decentralized manner, it is not exempt from compliance with securities regulations.</p>\n<p>As reiterated by Stephanie Avakian, Co-Director of the SEC&#8217;s Enforcement Division:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;The innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The Munchee Report</h2>\n<p>In December of 2017, the SEC released <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2017/33-10445.pdf\">another investigation</a>. The California-based company <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/munchee/\">Munchee</a> sought to raise $15 million through an ICO. The company sold &#8220;MUN&#8221; tokens with the intent to improve an iPhone app focused on restaurant meal reviews and buying and selling restaurant services using MUN tokens.</p>\n<p>Where the company ran afoul, as stated by the SEC order:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the course of the offering, the company and other promoters emphasized that investors could expect that efforts by the company and others would lead to an increase in value of the tokens. The company also emphasized it would take steps to create and support a secondary market for the tokens. Because of these and other company activities, investors would have had a reasonable belief that their investment in tokens could generate a return on their investment.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>The commission found that Munchee&#8217;s conduct &#8220;constituted unregistered securities offers and sales.&#8221; Representatives from Munchee agreed to cease and desist all ICO related activities.</p>\n<h3>The SEC&#8217;s cease and desist towards Munchee may act as a harbinger for future ICO litigation.</h3>\n<p>In response to the Munchee Order, William Hinman, Director of the Division of Corporate Finance stated that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Investors need the essential facts behind any investment opportunity so they can make fully informed decisions, and today&#8217;s Report confirms that sponsors of offerings conducted through the use of distributed ledger or blockchain technology must comply with the securities laws.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Avoiding Securities Classification by the SEC</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_42544\" style=\"width: 216px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" wp-image-42544\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/US-Court-Logo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"216\" height=\"216\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/US-Court-Logo.png 210w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/US-Court-Logo-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The <a href=\"http://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Securities%20Act%20Of%201933.pdf\">1933 Securities Act</a> still governs much of U.S. securities law 85 years later</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The standard for determining security classification is the <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12975052269830471754&amp;q=sec+v.+howey&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,48&amp;as_vis=1\">Howey Test</a>.

The classification hinges on investor&#8217;s perception before the purchase of the token. Any ICO that leads investors to believe they may earn future profits from a token risk the ire of the SEC.</p>\n<h2>Warnings Signs for Investors</h2>\n<p>The SEC Office of Investor Education and Advocacy issued an investor bulletin to help investors identify the warning signs that an ICO is not registered. Any of the following points could indicate that a token is an unregistered security, and thus a higher risk investment:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Guaranteed&#8221; high investment returns with little or no risk.</li>\n<li>You received the offer unsolicited and you don&#8217;t know the offerer.</li>\n<li>You&#8217;re pressured to buy RIGHT NOW.</li>\n<li>No net worth or income requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the SEC requires securities offerings to be registered unless an exemption from registration applies.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_41912\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-41912\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ico-fraud-sec-social-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"SEC Once Again Clamps Down on Fraudulent ICO\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ico-fraud-sec-social-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ico-fraud-sec-social-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ico-fraud-sec-social-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ico-fraud-sec-social.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Related Story: <a title=\"SEC Once Again Clamps Down on Fraudulent ICO\" href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/sec-clamps-fraudulent-ico/\">SEC Once Again Clamps Down on Fraudulent ICO</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Most exemptions require that investors are <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/ib_accreditedinvestors.pdf\">accredited</a> or have other income and net asset-based investment limits.

Media outlets are claiming Sindri Thor Stefansson to be a “mastermind”.

He somehow later made it to the airport, procuring a flight boarding pass under an assumed name (though he paid with his own debit card), and managed to put himself on a flight to Sweden carrying Iceland’s prime minister, Katrín Jakobsdóttir. He wasn’t discovered missing by guards until well after the plane was airbound. An international warrant was soon issued for Mr. Stefansson. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_150756\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-150756 size-full\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canalchurch.jpg\" alt=\"James Bond-like Bitcoin Villain in $2 Million Heist Finally Caught in Amsterdam\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canalchurch.jpg 800w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canalchurch-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canalchurch-768x513.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canalchurch-696x465.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/canalchurch-629x420.jpg 629w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Downtown Amsterdam</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Big Bitcoin Heist, as it has been tagged on the frozen island, involved bitcoin mining rigs grabbed in conjunction with four data center break-ins.

Indeed, it\'s now believed the proposal, which which seeks a technical fix that would return <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/startup-lost-160-million-still-wants-shake-ethereum/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">$264 million</a> in lost funds, is so contentious, some users may chose to defect to a new version of the code.</p>\n<p>Those in favor of the proposal point to the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/high-stakes-ethereums-fight-lost-funds-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">frequent losses</a> of ether due to buggy contracts, arguing that the platform should ensure against such avoidable mistakes. But on the other side, many warn that editing code after deployment could damage not only the security but also the integrity of the platform.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s clear no matter where you stand that the issue is contentious enough that if [EIP 999] goes forward and implements then it will generate a contentious hard fork,\" developer of ethereum\'s Mist browser Alex Van de Sande, said during the dev meeting on April 20.</p>\n<p>\"It\'s unavoidable that it will create a split,\" he continued.</p>\n<p>Still, it\'s important to note the size and influence of its backers. Spearheading the code change, for instance, is Parity Technologies, the ethereum software company behind the wallet that was impacted by the fund freeze.</p>\n<p>Founded by ethereum co-founder Dr. Gavin Wood in 2015, Parity is the second most popular ethereum software, used by almost one-third of the network.</p>\n<p>Speaking at the meeting, two representatives from Parity, communications officer Afri Schoedon and co-founder and CEO of the company Jutta Steiner, urged client developers to move forward with versions of the software equipped with the EIP 999 change.</p>\n<p>\"For me, the most logical step to take is just implement EIP 999, and I don\'t see what waiting another four weeks to conclude would benefit,\" Schoedon said.</p>\n<p>Steiner echoed this, emphasizing that implementing the code doesn\'t necessitate a split.</p>\n<p>However, there was notable disagreement on the assertion. Péter Szilágyi, the lead developer of Geth, the Ethereum Foundation-led ethereum software which serves the majority of users, disagreed, stating that if the code is made available it is likely to create a contentious split.</p>\n<p>Szilagyi said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We\'re talking about exactly the same networks and we\'re basically starting a tribalism war. I don\'t think we\'ll reach a consensus.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Geth versus Parity</h2>\n<p>And the discussion, while informal, shows ethereum\'s two biggest competing softwares are willing to go head-to-head on the issue, a development that could prove notable going forward.</p>\n<p>Stepping back, though, it\'s important to understand how Parity and Geth work together. Each software communicates directly with the ethereum virtual machine - which takes smart contract language and translates it into more general code - but Parity and Geth do so in different computer programming languages.</p>\n<p>By keeping up with each other\'s development, both softwares remain in sync and on the same blockchain not only with each other but also with ethereum more broadly.</p>\n<p>As such, it is critical that Geth and Parity contain the same code.</p>\n<p>If, for instance, one team implements EIP 999 and the other does not, the blockchain could fracture into two divergent groups - two ethereums.</p>\n<p>And just as the developers of the software implementations are split, so are ethereum users. An <a href=\"https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">ether vote recently</a> showed that a majority of people were opposed to the code change, but that voting method has come under <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/8e5oi9/eip999_the_selfdestructed_parity_multisig_wallet/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">much criticism</a>. Other developers are looking to social media to help them gauge community consensus, but so far, it remains inconclusive.</p>\n<p>As such, Parity\'s Steiner said that the company \"had not decided yet\" whether to implement the change. But representatives from the company told CoinDesk that it would be publishing a statement in the coming days.</p>\n<p>What is known, though, is that without Parity, ethereum would lose quite a bit.</p>\n<p>Not only does the company provide a significant portion of the mining power that secures transactions on the network, but it also represents a large portion of ethereum\'s developer community.</p>\n<p>Speaking to this and Parity\'s drive to hard fork so they retrieve user funds, Van de Sande told CoinDesk:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Parity is a valuable team of developers, and they have a very large incentive to create a fork and support it.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Dire disincentives</h2>\n<p>But even with an incentive to move forward with implementation, there are plenty of disincentives.</p>\n<p>For one, if a split on ethereum occurs, it won\'t merely impact transactions, but also the thousands of tokens and businesses built on top of the blockchain, Van de Sande said <a href=\"https://medium.com/@avsa/avoid-evil-twins-every-ethereum-app-pays-the-price-of-a-chain-split-e04c2a560ba8\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">in a blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>Following a split, each ethereum contract will simultaneously exist on both chains, or as Van de Sande described, \"If you own rare online cats, now every one of them will have an evil twin in a parallel universe.\"</p>\n<p>Speaking to CoinDesk, Van de Sande elaborated, saying, \"The best case scenario for a split is one in which the minority fork is a very small community and most apps know which way to move forward, but it still might create an adversarial community.\"</p>\n<p>However, there is hope for disincentivizing Parity from going forward without full consensus, he said.</p>\n<p>If a split occurs, it is likely that both ethereum blockchains will lose value as the community splits into two groups. This means that the money lost as a result of the Parity fund freeze will decrease in value.</p>\n<p>\"Since there is so much locked ether, that can amount to millions of dollars,\" Van de Sande said. \"Then they might not be so incentivized to fork it.\"</p>\n<p>Yet, that still doesn\'t eliminate the issue that hundreds of millions of dollars of ether are locked up whereby users (including some high-profile ICO issuers) can use them.</p>\n<p>As such, Van de Sande is working on a method to refund the Parity losses with the same amount of value as was lost in the fund freeze, although he wouldn\'t go into much detail.</p>\n<p>Instead, he told CoinDesk:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"The question is how to give value to those tokens, and that\'s something I, and I hope others, will probably be writing more about.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/warning-sign-on-barbed-wire-fence-1075026380?src=-SHgsmSbCijtiex8QFz75g-1-44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Warning of shock sign</a> via Shutterstock</em></p>\n', '<p>Parity is set on implementing their new proposal to recover frozen funds, and ethereum devs are worried there&#8217;s nothing to stop a blockchain split. </p>\n', 0, '327607', 'https://www.coindesk.com/even-ethereums-top-developers-think-blockchain-split-might-inevitable/', '2018-04-25 03:36:45', 1),

According to its ethics commission, cryptocurrency is “too secretive”.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-150950 size-full\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_490929688.jpg\" alt=\"Wisconsin Mulls Guidelines for Campaign Contributions in Bitcoin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_490929688.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_490929688-300x200.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_490929688-768x512.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_490929688-696x464.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_490929688-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>Most US states have adopted some crypto regulations according to a recently published <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/majority-of-us-states-with-stance-on-bitcoin-and-blockchain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a> by the Brookings Institution.

A growing number of political candidates are accepting cryptocurrencies to fund their campaigns. Republican Andrew Hemingway, the youngest gubernatorial candidate in <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/new-hampshire-governor-signs-bill-designed-to-protect-bitcoin-from-regulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">New Hampshire</a>, was the first to do so in 2014, as reported by <em>CNBC</em>.

He is also the beneficiary of the largest crypto donation worth $4,500. Democrat Patrick Nelson, running for Congress from New York, is accepting cryptocurrency contributions through the payments provider <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-launches-bitcoin-cash-debit-card-top-ups/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitpay</a>. “We&#8217;re a 21st century campaign and as such we embrace new technologies like bitcoin,” he tweeted. Democratic candidate for Congress Brian Forde of California and Republican Kelli Ward running for the Senate from Arizona are also taking bitcoin donations.</p>\n<p>The first candidate for the White House to do the same was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul who ran for the Republican nomination at the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Paul has in the past stated that the US government should adopt a “hands off” approach to controlling money. His campaign accepted bitcoin donations worth up to $100. That’s the maximum amount for individual contributions in cryptocurrency, as set by the Federal Election Commission.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What do you think about bitcoin contributions to political campaigns?

This was a chance for the Nano team to further streamline the block creation process, simplifying the variety of blocks minted within the chain down a single block type.</p>\n<p>The previous functions of open, change, send and receive blocks have now all been integrated into a single common block, greatly increasing the overall efficiency of the protocol while simplifying the code for developers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Nano Core Team is excited to share our roadmap and vision for the future of Nano: <a href=\"https://t.co/j8j1YgNKpK\">https://t.co/j8j1YgNKpK</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Nano (@nanocurrency) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nanocurrency/status/976227284054171649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 20, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>However, maintaining a completely original codebase for Nano comes with unexpected challenges, usually in the form of bugs.

It announced that blockchain tech allied with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the focus of the institution.</p>\n<p>According to a survey conducted by the federation last year, 65% of industry executives in Brazil said that their companies study blockchain implementation and 29% already evaluate analytics and cognitive computing or AI experiences.</p>\n<h2><strong>Proof-of-Concept</strong></h2>\n<p>According to the Federation, the first proof of concept, called Fingerprint, used the Corda platform and involved Brazilian banks Itaú, Bradesco and B3. The test, developed in R3&#8217;s cloud lab, created a database with fictitious information such as name, Brazilian official documents of identification (CPF and RG), age, address and telephone with document storage. The result has proven the ability of banks to operate collaboratively, with the guarantee of immutability of shared data, preservation of privacy and traceability of information.</p>\n<p>The second proof of concept (DNA) was developed using the <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/tag/hyperledger-fabric/\">Hyperledger Fabric</a>, backed by IBM, this time with the participation of all the institutions of the FEBRABAN Working Group. The tests allowed to evaluate the current capacity of the platforms, the differences between them and aspects related to the development. The next step is to carry out a pilot scheme, which is in the process of being set up and will be started soon after the conclusion of the DNA.</p>\n<p>Besides these, according to Febraban, Bradesco bank evaluates platforms in back office processes and solutions for startups of the program InovaBRA. One of the proofs-of-concept is related to guarantees in financial operations, such as the creation of an application to communicate with all members of the chain – for example, other particular banks.</p>\n<p>Febraban revealed that the Central Bank of Brazil is using the Ethereum platform to support the Reserve Transfer System (STR), one of the components of the <a href=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/Pom/Spb/Ing/Introduction.asp\">Brazilian Payment System</a> (SPB). The solution will be implemented in the event of any failures of existing platforms, the association added. &#8220;The regional ones could work through an alternative transfer system using DLT technology,&#8221; explained Aristides Cavalcante, deputy chief of the Information Technology Department of the Brazilian Central Bank.</p>\n<p>Febraban also revealed that it has been working with startups, among them e-Wally, a digital portfolio that has been testing Blockchain in the community of Paraisópolis, one of the smallest low-income regions in São Paulo.

Not only that, through the use of an innovative consensus protocol, IOTA is able to provide its customers with shorter confirmation times.</p>\n<h3>2. Micro-Payments</h3>\n<p>When using regular blockchain based payment portals, the transaction fees are usually set by the sender/initiator of the transaction. As a result of this, it becomes increasingly unfeasible to process smaller payments amounts.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of IOTA is its ability to facilitate small payments with the incurrence of little to no transaction fees.</p>\n<h3>3. Scalability</h3>\n<p>From a purely technical standpoint, we find that IOTA uses a processing module that becomes faster as its number of subscribers and transactions increase.</p>\n<p>It is also worth mentioning that when using IOTA, the time between placing a transaction and its validation starts to become zero as soon as a certain data-size is achieved.</p>\n<h3>4. Future Ready</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_44638\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-44638\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-trinity-wallet-social-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-trinity-wallet-social-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-trinity-wallet-social-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-trinity-wallet-social-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-trinity-wallet-social.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Related Story: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/iota-trinity-wallet/\">IOTA’s Impending Trinity Desktop Wallet Launch Catalyzes Price Recovery</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>One of the central issues for customers using the blockchain is that the technology is expensive in terms of its computational requirements and security assurance.</p>\n<p>For example, to implement Bitcoin mining processes, more and more computing power is needed as time goes on.</p>\n<p>However, IOTA reduces such heavy cost requirements by eliminating key areas of the conventional mining process.</p>\n<h3>5. Safety</h3>\n<p>When using the Blockchain, its owner, in theory, has the power to manipulate the system with new data, thereby modifying it for their personal gains. As a result of this, there exists a tangible dilemma for organizations looking to integrate the blockchain with externally auditable applications wherein the immutability of data needs to be maintained at all times.</p>\n<h2>What makes IOTA so appealing for industrial use cases?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_46297\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-46297\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-charging-social-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"IOTA Demonstrates Real-World Use Case With Smart Vehicle Charging Stations\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-charging-social-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-charging-social-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-charging-social-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iota-charging-social.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Related Story: <a title=\"IOTA Demonstrates Real-World Use Case With Smart Vehicle Charging Stations\" href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/iota-demonstrates-real-world-use-case-with-smart-vehicle-charging-stations/\">IOTA Demonstrates Real-World Use Case With Smart Vehicle Charging Stations</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In addition to the aforementioned advantages, IOTAs use can also go beyond its deployment as a simple payment protocol.</p>\n<p>For example, large business operations can choose to adopt IOTAs Tangle technology to support their IoT use cases.</p>\n<p>Similarly, through the use of Masked Authenticated Messaging (MAM), IOTA is able to streamline encrypted data transfers while maintaining a high level of integrity, data protection, and data access management.</p>\n<h2>Looking Ahead&#8230;</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_35466\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-35466\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IOTA-Socials-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"Introduction to IOTA – The Economy of Things\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IOTA-Socials-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IOTA-Socials-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IOTA-Socials-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IOTA-Socials.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Related Story: <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/iota/\">Introduction to IOTA &#8211; The Internet of Things</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>With the crypto revolution now in full swing, more and more users are looking for real-world technological options that can make alt-asset driven micropayments a reality.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/iota/\">IOTA</a> not only provides a platform that has the potential to facilitate digital payments for everyday transactions and trade but also delivers a technology which makes IoT communication a reality.</p>\n', '<p>With &#8220;blockchain technology&#8221; grabbing most of the headlines when it comes to crypto-innovation, IOTA is offering users with an all-new digital framework that promises to introduce a similar level of innovation but within a much larger, industrial scale.

One day I got this idea. How can we stop scams from happening and identify the quality information about cryptos? I brought the idea up to Komodo&#8217;s lead developer JL777 and he created a slack channel for us in Komodo&#8217;s slack.

With the increasing difficulty for investors to adequately distinguish between the good and the bad in crypto investing, many well-meaning investors have lost everything in their attempts at supporting the growth of this technology.</p>\n<p>Utrum believes that by developing an Artificial Intelligence backed, a community-driven platform which rewards users for their help in reviewing, rating, analyzing and predicting crypto projects, assets, and teams, these problems can be solved. Through the use of blockchain, Utrum is creating an ecosystem of supportive and educational guidance for investors of all caliber, as well as a marketplace for projects and providers to showcase to a targeted investment-rich community. Utrum will also implement community-voted moderators whose job it is to help regulate and manage the ecosystem according to community governance.</p>\n<p>The platform utilizes a new token, called OOT, which is used for various utilities and transactions within the community and marketplace, and which will be available on cryptocurrency exchanges in the future. Users who write reviews, perform analysis, and participate in rating crypto-projects or assets, are rewarded OOT based on their activity and reputation within the community.</p>\n<p>Utrum has a diverse and growing team of individuals passionate about creating a safer and more rewarding platform, helping users become smarter crypto investors, helping good projects gain visibility and helping the larger crypto-community. The team brings over 30 years combined experience in business development, technology, security, and community management.</p>\n<p>This new crypto startup is poised and passionate about developing a powerful community platform for crypto projects, developers, analysts, newbies, and investors to gain access to quality information and reviews.

This redirecting of DNS servers is a decade-old hacking technique that aims to undermine the Internet’s routing system. It can happen to any organization, including large banks.

That’s right—no difficult programming, just easy smart contract deployment in English, Chinese, Spanish, and many more languages. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They make this possible by creating tools that can convert natural language into programming language. Users can express their intention in their own language and the software will translate this into a smart contract. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8115\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-8115\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage.png 1000w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage-200x93.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage-768x359.png 768w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage-600x280.png 600w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage-370x173.png 370w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/matrixnaturallanguage-760x355.png 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: MATRIX Whitepaper</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This is a </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matrixainetwork\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>complex problem</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> the MATRIX team is trying to tackle. If the team succeeds, the MATRIX AI Network can bring the revolutionary yet highly esoteric smart contracts to the masses and let the average person take advantage of this new technology. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moreover, businesses that use the MATRIX AI Network are able to easily create smart contracts through this engine, eliminating the need for hiring expensive programmers and allowing managers to create their own smart contracts. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>AI Integration</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MATRIX AI Network will initially use artificial intelligence algorithms for two main purposes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first purpose is to consistently secure the blockchain platform in which AI is employed to conduct automated security audits. Through this, the AI automatically detects errors in smart contracts. This function perfectly complements the natural language smart contract development, as a lot of errors and security flaws can be expected in this feature. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Secondly, AI is used to constantly optimize the platform, making the platform self-optimizing. The AI algorithms will continuously look for ways to upgrade the platform, making it highly flexible. This construct replaces a lot of the inefficient models used by other blockchains to improve their platform. Because of their use of AI for optimization, the platform is constantly evolving and will never need to be forked. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Mining Chip Company and Second ICO</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MATRIX team is also building their own mining hardware. This because algorithms employed to run the MATRIX blockchain and its AI are computationally heavy, requiring heavy GPUs. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To prevent this from becoming an obstacle for miners, the team decided to design a new type of miner hardware. There is even rumored that this production will have its own ICO. The proprietary mining engine will allow for simultaneous mining of MAN tokens and AI computations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For more details, </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@keithtuskey/the-crypto-gift-that-just-keeps-on-giving-e2f4332ba35d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>click here.</b></a></p>\n<h3><strong>Hybrid Consensus Algorithm</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The blockchain platform is powered by a patented Proof-of-Stake/Proof-of-Work hybrid engine. This engine uses Proof-of-Stake as a dynamic random selection model for delegate nodes. These delegate nodes are able to mine based on the <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/proof-of-work-explained/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Proof-of-Work</strong></a> algorithm. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Interoperable Public and Private Chains </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MATRIX protocol allows for both public and private chains to run on the platform. Both types of chains are also interoperable. Companies require private, permissioned networks which are provided by the MATRIX platform and these permissioned networks are also able to link to public networks on the blockchain.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>High-Speed Transactions </strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MATRIX team claims it has achieved 50,000 transactions per second on its testnet, making it the fastest blockchain platform at the moment.

The platform doesn’t disappoint in this area, either. MATRIX is managed by an </span><a href=\"https://www.matrix.io/index.html#TEAM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>all-star team</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, especially in the field of AI, with team members having won </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@theblockanalyst/award-winning-ai-scientist-launches-matrix-ai-network-to-take-smart-contracts-mainstream-8a417fdd7f81\"><b>several awards</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in this area. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The CEO is </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/owen-tao-54328a156/\"><b>Owen Tao</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. He possesses a strong track record of leading high-tech startups and a rich experience in managing product development. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Chief Network Architect is </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E5%8A%B2%E5%8D%8E-%E6%9D%8E-b49493157/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Bill Li</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a leading expert in communication and IC design. He is a major contributor to 3G, 4G, and 5G standards in China and was the chief architect of China’s first wifi transceiver. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Their eadership and technical expertise comes from </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@matrixainetwork/review-of-huobi-talk-interview-with-steve-deng-f0223dbf01f1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Professor Steve Deng</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. He is the Chief AI Scientist and has a strong track record in computer architecture, machine learning, and data analytics. He has written over 50 peer-reviewed papers. He also wrote a book on AI that is widely accepted in higher educational spheres. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Besides these impressive leaders, the team is backed by a strong board of </span><a href=\"https://www.matrix.io/index.html#TEAM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>advisors</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and by a team of 25 developers with experience at large multinationals such as Alibaba, Huawei, Microsoft and Facebook. In a recent conference, team announced that they have some fresh PhDs coming in from prestigious universities, which brings in additional academic backing to Prof. Steve Deng and his ex-students he hired. </span></p>\n<h2><b>MATRIX&#8217;s Current Status</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The team indicates that they’re ahead of schedule. As </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@keithtuskey/matrix-ai-network-my-case-2-for-the-1-crypto-381d077610b8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>mentioned by a team member</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, they have currently completed the architecture of the artificial intelligence neural network, the algorithm of MATRIX’s main network AI module, the new consensus algorithm, and a prototype of the AI mining machine. It must be noted here that the MATRIX team already possesses an award-winning AI platform, which is likely the reason for their finished AI products. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The same team member </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matrixainetwork/status/982332181296091136\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>indicated</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that the remaining work now is to deploy these finished functionalities to the blockchain network development. This indicates that the MATRIX team has first concentrated on their AI functionalities and is now working on completing their blockchain structure. Given the complexities of both technologies relative to each other, it can be stated that the hardest part is already done. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The MATRIX AI Network will have its own blockchain, the MATRIX mainnet. The team behind the platform is planning to partially launch this mainnet in Q3 2018 and expects a full launch of its platform in March 2019. In the meantime, demos and beta versions of their services are expected to run on the </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Ethereum blockchain</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. So for now, the MATRIX token MAN is an ERC-20 token. But as soon as the mainnet is launched, MATRIX will have its own native cryptocurrency. MAN will be distributed to node owners and miners for running applications and for using AI services. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Should You Invest in MATRIX?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In its early stages, the MATRIX platform keeps on giving. Their function allowing people to use their natural language to create smart contracts has the potential to be an industry game-changer and the same goes for their AI self-optimization and security algorithms. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Their involvement with One Belt, One Road—one of the biggest infrastructure projects in world’s history ($1 trillion)—is likely the biggest partnership in the entire crypto industry. Besides this partnership, the project is highly networked in the blockchain space, has valuable VC backing, and is included in multiple collaborations. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a secondary (or tertiary or even quadriary) business focus, the project is also planning to launch its own mining hardware and will likely attract investments for this business through a second ICO. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If it was a blockchain platform only, the MATRIX AI Network would be facing fierce competition even with its claimed superior transaction speed. However, the combination with AI, a field in which the team comprises renown experts, makes the platform could stick out from its competition and gives it nearly unlimited growth potential. It uses AI to make the platform self-adaptive, secure, and fault-proof. The upcoming MATRIX AI Network is designed to be highly flexible and has the potential to be used for limitless variation of future applications. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Where most platform blockchains have to settle with a few collaborations, the MATRIX AI Network has already established an impressively strong network of partners even before the launch of its mainnet. This network can greatly assist in creating a much desired network effect for the MATRIX platform, giving it the potential to become one of the biggest in the industry. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Currently, MAN is only listed on Idex, Gate.io and the fork of EtherDelta, but it’s only a matter of time before a project of this stature will be listed on major exchanges. This and the upcoming launch of their mainnet are events to look forward to trade-wise. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Given all these early stage achievements and MATRIX’s experienced team, I’d say investing in MATRIX AI Network could be a potential moonshot, especially since this project isn’t in the top 100 yet.</span></p>\n', '<p>MATRIX presents itself as an intelligent blockchain 3.0 platform and combines blockchain technology with artificial intelligence.

On top of that, if the issuer is looking for users that meet certain criteria (be it a profession or location), they can verify that users actually fit those backgrounds.</p>\n<p>In this way, CoinList CEO Andy Bromberg believes he has found a way to enable airdropped offerings at a time when many in the industry are looking for a compliant service. Token issuers themselves have had no shortage of issues here, with some, including video-monetization service Stream, even <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/spooked-sec-video-streaming-ico-halts-token-release/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">backing off</a> the concept altogether because of the regulatory uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the SEC hasn\'t taken a formal stance on how it views crypto tokens delivered through ICO, airdrops or other forms of sales and giveaways, but it\'s clear regulators are <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ex-cftc-chair-gary-gensler-on-tokens-securities-and-the-sec/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">currently investigating</a> that question.</p>\n<p>Still, Bromberg is confident in his assembled solutions, and in interview, he hinted at dialogue with regulators that would attest to the viability of the service.</p>\n<p>\"In our typical compliance first mindset, we sat down and said: Is there a way to pull this off without violating securities laws? And what we came to is the compliant Airdrops product,\" Bromberg told CoinDesk.</p>\n<p>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"I can\'t comment on individual discussions with the SEC. What I can say is we are in frequrent communication with them and -- based on our understanding of securities law -- we are very comfortable with this.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not only does the startup believe it has a solution for working under existing securities law, but it\'s also opening up its existing user base of past investors to new token issuers. Once users have gone through the company\'s compliance flow, they will be verified to receive airdrops, and CoinList will take a nominal fee from users (less than $1 per airdrop) to accept new tokens.</p>\n<p>To date, according to its website, CoinList has run $850 million worth of token sales through its platform, representing what could be a vast pool of people interested in investing and taking part in future crypto tokens.</p>\n<h2>Compliance as a service</h2>\n<p>While that pool of potential investors will likely be attractive for token issuers, Coinlist\'s product is opt-in - a feature added to reduce spam and mitigate the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/airdrop-attack-coming-monero-fork-condemned-as-privacy-threat/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">security threats</a> that have become a common annoyance from crypto enthusiasts involved in such offerings.</p>\n<p>Also, CoinList says it\'s only willing to work with token issuers that are focused on complying with the law. And that\'s partly because CoinList will be promoting these projects for issuers.</p>\n<p>Still, CoinList\'s Airdrops product seems to be set up whereby all the compliance effort is offloaded from the issuer, which many issuers will like since many are not securities law experts.</p>\n<p>CoinList\'s product allows for airdrops that might fall under Regulation S and Regulation D and will also collaborate with AngelList spin-off Republic, which has a license to sell securities under limited conditions to non-accredited investors using Regulation CF.</p>\n<p>The company is also doing a country-by-country analysis to determine what sorts of checks issuers will need to do in order to airdrop to users around the world.</p>\n<p>Depending not only on the goals of the issuer and who they want to give to, different levels of know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will be needed, and whether issuers can to both accredited and unaccredited investors or one or the other.</p>\n<p>And all of this has already proven enticing to token issuers. Bromberg told CoinDesk the company is in negotiations with more than one issuer to use its Airdrops product but declined to disclose which ones.</p>\n<p>While CoinList has so far been focused on fundraising, Bromberg said that potential issuers will not have to have a token sale on the platform in order to use the new product.</p>\n<p>\"We\'re interested in exploring this model where in some cases ... funding might be separate from distribution,\" Bromberg said.</p>\n<h2>The right recipients</h2>\n<p>Still, different companies might have very different goals for an airdrop, and Bromberg gave two examples of use cases he believes could work well.</p>\n<p>For example, he said a company with a token it believes regulators will recognize as a utility token, something used primarily to access a certain service, can use CoinList to get it in the hands of people who are likely to be the most interested.</p>\n<p>This issuer might target software developers, and in this case, CoinList would enable them to authorize the airdrop to check a users Github API and distribute to developers with a certain commitment frequency.</p>\n<p>Getting the tokens in the hands of people who will ultimately use the token as intended \"will help that network get to a place where that token is no longer a security,\" Bromberg said.</p>\n<p>Still, there could also be companies that want to issue securities, Bromberg said: \"A company could tokenize some of their equity and give that equity, give those tokens, to early users on the product.\"</p>\n<p>As such, CoinList will also offer a wide array of ways to authenticate users as meeting certain objectives, be it a certain audience on Twitter, a certain location in the world or a certain occupation. It can use APIs off other websites to verify these target goals to insure that an airdrop recipient meets them.</p>\n<p>Because it is running KYC/AML checks on all of them, it also verifies that each user receives a token allocation only once. \"It prevents gaming the system,\" Bromberg said.</p>\n<p>It\'s an approach designed for an excess of caution, but one that\'s also ready to adapt.</p>\n<p>\"Whether or not these things are securities, we are treating them like securities to be as safe as possible,\" Bromberg said. To that end, some startups have been <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/really-like-talk-sec-ico/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">meeting with the SEC</a> to ask for what\'s called a no action letter, a document that says regulators believe a given company has not violated securities law.</p>\n<p>If something like that comes to pass, CoinList is confident enough that the platform is ready for that, too.</p>\n<p>Bromberg concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We\'d be open to airdropping without the compliance layer.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/color-jelly-beans-candy-1075353758\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Colorful candies</a> image via Shutterstock.</em></p>\n', '<p>The company has worked on token distribution and fundraising so far, but its latest product focuses on giving away tokens to spur user adoption.</p>\n', 0, '327644', 'https://www.coindesk.com/coinlist-compliant-airdrop-token-giveaways/', '2018-04-25 15:36:55', 1),

Binance and KuCoin, by comparison, are trading with volumes of $2 billion and $69 million respectively. </span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.com/switcheo/what-weve-learnt-after-1-week-of-running-neo-s-first-live-dex-5575bd60243e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Yeu reports that improvements for Switcheo</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are necessary and has communicated the team’s priorities over the coming weeks. This includes confirmations in under 30 seconds, withdrawals in under a minute,  transaction broadcasting on off-chain servers, and support for Ledger wallets. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To compete with major exchanges like Binance and Kucoin, Switcheo will have to make trading on their DEX as pain-free as possible. UI improvements seem to be a consistently important priority for them. This, coupled with the eventual support for several assets, could transform them into a strong trading centre. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Will NEO’s Ecosystem Grow as a Result?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a purely trading perspective, this boasts very good news for NEO and NEP-5 tokens. Support for decentralized trading of these tokens is sparse when compared to other coins, and Switcheo’s launch means that NEO and NEP-5 tokens have been injected with new life. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, all NEP-5 tokens become available for trading as soon as the ICO ends. It can be imagined that projects built on NEO will be motivated because of this, plus the aforementioned reduced trading fees with the use of the SWH token, which encourages trading on this particular DEX. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering that NEO is also developing its own DEX, the </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-the-future-holds-neonexchange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>NEX</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one might think that this would leave the two DEXs in direct competition. It doesn’t seem likely, however, and it is more probable that the two will complement each other. If Switcheo supports all NEP-5 tokens, then NEX’s tokens will be supported on it, and SWH token by NEX.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there is an ever larger reason as to why NEO’s ecosystem could expand this year. Many of the NEP-5 tokens we mentioned, such as Ontology, DeepBrainChain, and TheKey, are launching their mainnets this year. With support from a DEX like Switcheo, we could expect to see large trade volumes and price jumps for these tokens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems that we have an eventful year for NEP-5 tokens. Decentralized exchanges have hijacked many discussions, but within that sphere we now have a significant talking point in the performance of these tokens. No doubt, exchanges like Switcheo will act as a conduit of adoption for these tokens. On top of that, with several NEO-based mainnet launches, trading possibilities, and creation of decentralized applications puts NEO and its brethren even higher on the scale of investment opportunities this year.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can </span><a href=\"https://switcheo.exchange/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>place trade orders on Switcheo</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> right now.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/neo-what-the-future-holds/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Will NEO Have a Smooth Road Ahead?</strong></a></p>\n', '<p>As the second quarter of 2018 passes by confidently, brushing off any anxiety arising from the turbulence of the&hellip;</p>\n', 0, '8181', 'https://www.investinblockchain.com/switcheo/', '2018-04-25 15:42:14', 1),

Announced Wednesday, decentralized internet startup Blockstack (through its venture capital fund, the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/ico-meets-vc-blockstack-raises-25-million-decentralized-internet-fund/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Blockstack Signature Fund</a>) and exchange platform ShapeShift are jointly offering a <a href=\"https://universalwallet.eventbrite.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">$50,000 bounty</a> to the team or developer that makes the best open-source \"universal\" crypto wallet.</p>\n<p>Contestants need to use Blockstack\'s authentication, storage and encryption technology combined with ShapeShift\'s API for token exchange. The goal is to build a wallet that supports almost any native token, even tokens that haven\'t been created yet, before the deadline on June 29.</p>\n<p>Xan Ditkoff, a growth partner at Blockstack and producer at Blockstack\'s Signature Fund, explained:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We\'re super early in this space. There are undoubtedly winners that have yet to even appear yet. It\'s important that a wallet can support digital assets that have yet to be created.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Most cryptocurrency wallets only support at most a handful of tokens, forcing enthusiasts to juggle multiple wallets and sometimes keep their tokens on custodial platforms like exchanges.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://info.shapeshift.io/sites/default/files/Jaxx%20Wallet%20Integration%20Release.pdf\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Jaxx wallet</a> added ShapeShift support in 2016, although that wallet provider is known to have some <a href=\"https://vxlabs.com/2017/06/10/extracting-the-jaxx-12-word-wallet-backup-phrase/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">security vulnerabilities</a>. Plus, it can\'t support all tokens the way this upcoming wallet aims to.</p>\n<h2>Hedging bets</h2>\n<p>Notably, the partnership says much about the changing demands of crypto consumers, as it grew out of Blockstack\'s concern that not supporting certain coins could cost developer interest.</p>\n<p>\"You shouldn\'t be deterred from building on Blockstack just because your community\'s atomic unit of use, or wealth, or whatever, your token, isn\'t represented on our platform,\" Ditkoff told CoinDesk.</p>\n<p>\"As soon as we came up with that idea, ShapeShift was an obvious partner. They\'ve probably done the most of any project ... for users to hold, exchange and add new tokens,\" he continue.</p>\n<p>The partnership also is good for ShapeShift\'s bottom line, since the platform will earn revenue whenever wallet users convert their tokens through the API.</p>\n<p>\"<b></b>Much like you don\'t have a website that serves all of the needs of an individual, you won\'t have a single wallet or decentralized application that serves all of the needs of an individual as well,\" a ShapeShift spokesperson said.</p>\n<p>More broadly, in Ditkoff\'s view, sometimes cryptocurrency tribalism can create familiar silos centered around specific tokens. But cooperation between teams often produces more innovative results than niche experiments, he said.</p>\n<p>Submissions won\'t only be judged based on the quality of the code. Judges will also consider how easy the wallet\'s code is to audit and use.</p>\n<p>\"We\'d love to see other developers use this going forward,\" Ditkoff said, concluding:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"This space, in general, is going to succeed, or it\'s not. It\'s not going to be a winner take-all-type thing.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/bitcoin-leather-wallet-on-wooden-table-1076474288?src=CbDu6OYDi3-Hdmqa5ds08w-1-34\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">Crypto wallet</a> image via Shutterstock</em></p>\n', '<p>The two startups are offering developers $50,000 to build a wallet that would support almost any token, even those that haven’t been created yet.</p>\n', 0, '327674', 'https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-bounty-blockstack-offer-50k-reward-for-best-shapeshift-wallet/', '2018-04-25 15:36:55', 1),

These systems are, to use Loyakk’s phrasing, “unsecure, chaotic and centralized.” This leads to data breaches, IP theft, privacy issues, and contract disputes, as well as limited governance. Loyakk is aiming to solve these issues currently plaguing many big companies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk is transforming the status quo by introducing a platform that, to </span><a href=\"https://www.loyakk.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>quote them</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enables secure, permissioned sharing of data &amp; value movement through smart contracts with business rules &amp; security policies. </span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company is positioning itself as a solution for large-scale enterprises that want to leverage the power of blockchain but don’t want to sacrifice control or participate in an unproven experiment. </span><b></b></p>\n<h3><b>The Team</b></h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8224\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM.png 822w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM-200x117.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM-768x449.png 768w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM-600x351.png 600w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM-370x217.png 370w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.52.28-AM-760x445.png 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most blockchain projects you come across claim to have stacked teams and big name advisors. In the case of Loyakk, this is largely indisputable. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk was founded by CEO </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/salimali/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Salim Ali</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and CTO </span><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jitutelang/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Jitu Telang</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ali is a frequent speaker on blockchain and its impact on enterprises, and comes from a background that spans blockchain, enterprise applications, and big data platforms. Teland, on the other hand, is a seasoned technical expert whose experience includes engineering, development, and analyst roles (most recently involving large-scale, realtime response, and data mining platforms).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you review the full team, you quickly see the yin and yang of the founders trending through the rest of the organization. The Loyakk team is a unique marriage of blockchain, big data, and enterprise software expertise. The people working with Loyakk are unanimously top-tier, and the leadership team has led marketing efforts for multibillion-dollar solutions at SAP, Oracle-Siebel, and VMware (to name a few).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk has industry advisors from the likes of Nissan, McAfee, SAP, and the world of professional sports. Here are a few key advisors:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonythomasa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anthony Thomas</a></b></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/patricia-hatter-5473873/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patricia Hatter</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbecher/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jonathan Becher</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company’s site also boasts testimonials from executives at Uber, Time Inc., and Intel. The bottom line here is that the people surrounding Loyakk are of a caliber that many blockchain projects and ICOs could only dream of. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Technology: The Vega Enterprise Relationship Platform<br />\n</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk started development of its Vega platform on the premise that public blockchains are not “enterprise-ready” and need to be “adapted” to handle the complexities of relationship structures within enterprise business networks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk has had a leg up on many competitors because they existed long before the blockchain hype train really kicked into gear. Their star-studded list of clients have all been using Loyakk V1 (a non-blockchain system), and Loyakk has been able to work with these clients to develop a blockchain-based iteration of the product. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These clients include:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8225 size-full\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.30.44-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"630\" height=\"81\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.30.44-AM.png 630w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.30.44-AM-200x26.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.30.44-AM-600x77.png 600w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-8.30.44-AM-370x48.png 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The result is Vega, a blockchain-enabled decentralized business network platform that addresses the security and efficiency issues mentioned above. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform will use (patent-pending) nested blockchain architecture and a proprietary consensus mechanism (full technical description </span><a href=\"https://loyakk.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Loyakk-Vega-Solution-Architecture-Overview-O24.pdf\"><b>here</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) to share and/or move data and value between business network participants based on identity, relationship, and business rules. This will give enterprises a better way to store and utilize critical data within a unified business ecosystem, all while enjoying the verifiable, auditable, immutable, and secure benefits of blockchain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a B2B and intra-business solution of the highest order. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The platform is described as having 6 primary benefits, which are:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It ensures secure data exchange.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It enables (permissioned) visibility and access.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It allows for accurate and timely movement of digital assets.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It creates one standardized record. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps accelerate complex deals and transactions.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It offers the potential to improve organizational governance.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The past:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8226\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.32-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"232\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.32-AM.png 586w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.32-AM-200x84.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.32-AM-370x156.png 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future:</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8227\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.54-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.54-AM.png 549w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.54-AM-200x97.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screen-Shot-2018-04-24-at-9.07.54-AM-370x180.png 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an additional example of how Loyakk’s technology is solving tangible problems, check out the Medium article on how the Vega platform will rein in </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/loyakk-vega-blog/how-loyakk-reins-in-commercial-contract-disputes-with-blockchain-5858ad5ba112\"><b>commercial contract disputes</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk is not alone in their pursuit of building private blockchain systems for businesses. This angle of approaching business use cases is extremely valuable because of its multi-billion dollar target market.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Some platform vendors like Microsoft, IBM, JM Morgan, and R3 are focused on building generic platforms; Loyakk stands out as the first one that is building an enterprise-grade application for businesses to leverage blockchain for specific use cases. Loyakk’s enterprise relationship management application has the potential to become the de facto enterprise blockchain application that can help bring blockchain to the mainstream and address real business pain points.</p>\n<h3><b>The Loyakk (LYK) Token</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Vega platform will be powered by its own native token, LYK. Anyone wishing to interact with the Loyakk-powered business network will need LYK. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LYK is a purpose-built token that is described as a “</span><a href=\"https://medium.com/loyakk-vega-blog/lyk-a-function-rich-token-54967fe60f29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>utility+++</b></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">token.” In essence, this means that the LYK will offer more functionality than the average utility token. To quote the Medium article above: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LYK token materially furthers the concept of utility that goes well beyond just providing businesses with access to the Loyakk Vega Platform and applications.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does this in 3 primary ways:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LYK token helps control “appropriate” visibility with internal permissioning rules.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LYK token specifies the format, interface, and rules for data exchange, thus paving the way for interoperability. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The LYK token can propagate security policies, rules, and identity controls across the network. This can help ensure and enforce governance measures. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loyakk is about to launch a public token sale, which could prove an appealing opportunity for investors who believe in the disruptive vision of the company. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Loyakk token sale commences on June 15, 2018.

Kali Digital Ecosystems operates a multi <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/tag/exchanges/\" rel=\"\">cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p>\n<p>Kali Digital Ecosystems has reportedly hired the legal firm Khaitan and Co. as its legal council. The petitioners argue that the sudden restrictions imposed by the Central Bank should be deemed illegal as they are a clear violation of laws prescribed in the constitution.

For elaboration, we call this particular vulnerability batchOverflow,\" PeckShield\'s post on the 22nd explained. \"We point out that batchOverflow is essentially a classic integer overflow issue.\"</p>\n<h2>Countless coins</h2>\n<p>The batchOverflow post outlines how the batchTransfer function in a contract has a maximum number of tokens that can be sent in a transaction, adding that the value of the tokens being transferred must be less than the total number of tokens that were generated. However, the \"_value\" parameter - one of the two that determine the total number of tokens - can be manipulated, which would then change another variable, resulting in an attacker being able to create as many tokens as they\'d like.</p>\n<p>Further, the attacker can bypass the barriers in the contract which would normally ensure that a reasonable number of tokens are being transferred.</p>\n<p>\"With <em>amount</em> zeroed, an attacker can then pass the sanity checks in lines 258-259 and make the subtraction in line 261 irrelevant,\" the post explained, noting:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"Finally, here comes the interesting part: as shown in lines 262-265, the balance of the two receivers would be added by the extremely large _value without costing a dime in the the attacker\'s pocket!\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>While initial reports indicated all ERC-20 tokens may be impacted, the \"batchTransfer\" function is not part of the token standard.</p>\n<p>The Medium post did not list the vulnerable projects, though it did note that the BeautyChain was the first project they discovered.

Technologies being developed by the team are going to have a major impact on the way people see parts of Blockchain technology, most notably consensus algorithms such as EOS’ DPoS mechanism”.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roger then introduced the organisation as one aiming to become Oceania’s most stable and secure EOS Block Producer (BP). EOS Block Producers are points of connection in a Blockchain which collect transactional information and pack them into blocks. According to the EOS.IO Technical White Paper, the consensus algorithm utilised by EOS – Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) – requires 21 Block Producers to run the entirety of the EOS network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Block Producer elections help mitigate centralization and maintain the stability of the EOS network. Using the DPoS algorithm, those who hold EOS tokens can vote for Block Producers through a continuous approval voting system. Anyone can choose to participate in block production, and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks, provided they can persuade token holders to vote for them.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-135598\" src=\"https://www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1054\" height=\"645\" srcset=\"https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2.png 1054w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2-300x184.png 300w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2-768x470.png 768w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2-1024x627.png 1024w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2-640x392.png 640w, https://248qms3nhmvl15d4ne1i4pxl-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/image2-2-360x220.png 360w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1054px) 100vw, 1054px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roger explained that to achieve this, “</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the WhatEOS team has created multiple specialist departments, including the cloud service development team, legal team, and a vetted security team, with additional help and support from world-renowned cryptocurrency development communities</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WhatEOS uses local and cloud servers to store data, creating a hybrid system which will adopt the advantages, and alleviate some of the disadvantages of both systems. They take a multi-regional approach to building the node, which will help prevent it from facing certain geo-political obstacles while ensuring that it won’t be exclusively running in one single country for security and availability purposes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WhatEOS consists of an exceedingly experienced and educated team, including members of many other highly successful Blockchain projects, exchange platforms and related companies. Many members of the team have previously worked on projects together and are able to communicate effectively with each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WhatEOS has a number of co-sponsors, providing funding to set up the crucial infrastructure to run the system. These consist of the aforementioned CollinStar Capital; Hyper Pay &#8211; a company providing a multi-functional zero-fee digital asset wallet; and JNB &#8211; an exchange platform based in Japan, focused on providing strong service, security and support.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, there are four main strategic partners joining WhatEOS. These are: Alibaba Cloud, who will be providing WhatEOS with world-class cloud computing infrastructure; Hatchstone, a VC investment and advisory firm, which will be providing legal and compliance advisory; and HPX, a cryptocurrency exchange with a focus on providing RMB pairs for leading cryptocurrencies with zero-fees for EOS trades. Finally, the CollinStar Joint Laboratory, based at Monash University’s Clayton campus in Melbourne, with a newly established arm at Hong Kong Polytechnic university, will provide necessary academic research to assist with WhatEOS’ future services.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The WhatEOS ecosystem is held accountable by a three-part system. Firstly, with a range of rigorous internal control measures, then using professional external auditing services to act as a more in-depth accountability system, and lastly by the community, ensuring that WhatEOS works in the best interests of the EOS and Blockchain community. The architecture of WhatEOS’ server is highly capable, with an advanced security design, incident response plan, and robust disaster recovery strategy. This, alongside WhatEOS’ technical capabilities including all aspects relating to the industry – from research to building core infrastructure, to complex management systems, to app development, and beyond, makes it a top-tier competitor in the race to become an EOS Block Producer.</span></p>\n<p><b>Contact:</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Influence Matters Public Relations</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:blockchain@inmatt.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blockchain@inmatt.com</span></a></p>\n', '<p>This is a paid-for submitted press release.

Malta is developing a digital innovation authority, called the Malta Digital Technology (Arrangements and Services) Authority, and a legal framework for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Its mission is to support innovation and new technologies for financial services whilst ensuring effective investor protection, financial market integrity and financial stability. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of the Authority’s remit is to promote government policies that favour the development of Malta as a digital technology hub, including the adoption of this technology in the public sector to drive the recognition of Malta as a blockchain leader. As well as choosing to domicile in Malta, Poseidon is delighted to be working with the Maltese government to explore the possibilities to scope out a pilot programme on the Poseidon platform to support the government’s climate and economic development goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laszlo Giricz, Founder of Poseidon, said “We are very excited to be part of Malta’s growing blockchain community and commend the government on the regulatory framework they have established. We are delighted the Maltese Government is exploring the possibilities with us to pilot the Poseidon platform, one of a number of pilots we are undertaking to demonstrate the tangible application of our technology, the demand for our tokens, and the difference this can make in the fight against climate change.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Minister for Financial Services, Digital Economy &amp; Innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister of Malta, Silvio Schembri, said, “The Maltese government is a global forerunner in regulating the operation of companies that work with digital technologies such as blockchain. We are thrilled to be working with Poseidon whose values firmly align with our own to truly address climate change meaningfully, through supporting projects that protect our planet.”</span></p>\n', '<p>This is a paid-for submitted press release.

The company’s own digital currency, the MARK (MRK), which underpins trading in the MARK.SPACE universe, has also been added to CoinMarketCap where global investors can track the performance of the currency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MARK.SPACE operates the world’s first open-source, platform-agnostic social VR and AR ecosystem. The MARK.SPACE universe consists of numerous cities, which are each divided into 35 districts with a maximum of 35 blocks in each district. Each block is then subdivided into no more than 256 individual units. There are currently five cities planned for the MARK.SPACE universe, each based on a common language for users – English, Russian, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Units are the building blocks of the MARK.SPACE universe &#8211; unique virtual spaces of 64 sq/m each that can be purchased or leased by businesses or individuals. The MARK.SPACE universe has been designed so that the number of units is strictly limited, giving unit owners the unique opportunity to benefit as the value of their unit appreciates over time. Unit owners on MARK.SPACE can also lease their space to generate revenue or can sell their unit to another user. Just as in the real world, it is expected that units in prime districts will quickly accumulate in value over time. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CoinMarketCap is the most popular price tracking and comparison platform for the global cryptocurrency market. It lists the vast majority of the most popular cryptocurrencies globally, and shows the current value of each coin in dollars and Bitcoins. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yana Kontorovich, Co-founder and CEO of MARK.SPACE, said:</span></i></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“We are thrilled to open the doors to the MARK.SPACE universe today, and to welcome businesses, investors, and individuals from around the world to our platform. We truly believe that MARK.SPACE represents the future of the internet as we transition from words and pictures on a screen to a truly immersive virtual experience. Today’s announcement, alongside our listing on CoinMarketCap, represent major milestones in our journey towards achieving that vision.”</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kontorovich continued, “I’m particularly humbled that we’re making this momentous step today, which is also my birthday. To celebrate these three exciting landmarks, we are offering pioneer investors who purchase units today a special gift &#8211; free bonus points that can be exchanged for commercial units and other services in the MARK.SPACE universe.”</span></p>\n<p><b>Media Contact</b></p>\n<p><b>Dmitriy Filonenko</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing &amp; PR Manager</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MARK.SPACE</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Email: pr@mark.space</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Official Website: </span><a href=\"https://mark.space/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://mark.space/</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Media: </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@markspace\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://medium.com/@markspace</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                          </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markspaceio?lang=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://twitter.com/markspaceio?lang=en</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                          </span><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2294605.0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2294605.0</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">                          </span><a href=\"https://telegram.me/markspaceio\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://telegram.me/markspaceio</span></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n', '<p>This is a paid-for submitted press release.

The Wibcoin token is considered to be a fully legal cryptocurrency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many conditions have to be met before establishing any bank.

Ironically, the bug was <a title=\"\" href=\"https://paritytech.io/security-alert-2/\" rel=\"noopener\">caused</a> by Parity’s multiple signatory code &#8211; which was supposed to increase security.</p>\n<p>To combat this, an EIP-999 was raised to discuss a potential update that would “patch” the faulty smart contract and allow users to gain access to their ‘locked’ ETH. At the time of writing, the locked ETH <a title=\"\" href=\"https://ethereumprice.org/calculator/\" rel=\"noopener\">equates</a> to a staggering $418 million. And since every decision on open-source projects needs to be publicly approved, the EIP ran a “<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote/poll/35\" rel=\"noopener\">voting</a>” system to determine which choice would be best suited to public interests. To vote, users staked their ETH, and this ensures all voters are serious about the topic.</p>\n<p>Speaking about the EIP’s benefits on <a title=\"\" href=\"https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-999.md\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub</a>, was Parity developer Afri Schoedon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>“This proposal is necessary because the Ethereum protocol does not allow the restoration of self-destructed contracts and there is no other simple way to enable the affected users and companies regaining access to their tokens and Ether.”</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Another Blockchain Split?</h3>\n<p>However, in contrast to Schoedon, developers of the other <a title=\"\" href=\"http://ethereum.org/\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum</a> client Geth, argue that if the code from EIP 999 is made available, it may lead to a contentious split in the Ethereum blockchain.</p>\n<p>Péter Szilágyi, the lead developer of Geth, provided his comments on the issue on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coindesk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@coindesk</a> asked me a few questions about EIP-999, but for some reason didn&#39;t add even one of my answers into their piece.

With such a split, tokens built on top of Ethereum will also be affected.</p>\n<p>As Alex Van de Sande of the Ethereum Foundation writes in a <a title=\"\" href=\"https://medium.com/@avsa/avoid-evil-twins-every-ethereum-app-pays-the-price-of-a-chain-split-e04c2a560ba8\" rel=\"noopener\">blog post</a>, he thinks chain splits should only be considered if the entire ecosystem is at risk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I think for the sake of the platform, it’s not fair to create a burden on every token. I believe the way to move forward is to build not only better contracts but also insurance systems to hedge against eventual failures and to create a (voluntary) fund to minimize the damages to victims of these failures. Chain splits are bound to happen eventually, but they should be only risked when the whole ecosystem is at risk or needs some sort of upgrade.&#8221;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Voting Results</h2>\n<p>Surprisingly, while voting for returning the lost funds to their owners seems to be the most obvious option, the reality shows a grave picture. Developers and onlookers are divided on both sides of the spectrum; with some in favour of the coins being released, and the others against it.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-27747\" src=\"https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voting-results.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"701\" height=\"187\" srcset=\"https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voting-results.jpg 1173w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voting-results-350x93.jpg 350w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voting-results-768x205.jpg 768w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voting-results-800x213.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px\" /></p>\n<p>In all, 55 percent of the voters cast their vote against the proposition, with only 39 percent voting for, and the remaining five percent saying they “don’t care.”</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-27746\" src=\"https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voiting-Pie-Chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"498\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voiting-Pie-Chart.jpg 567w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voiting-Pie-Chart-350x244.jpg 350w, https://btcmanager.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Voiting-Pie-Chart-300x209.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px\" /></p>\n<p>While the votes do show that the cryptocurrency community can be ‘heartless,’ the argument is rooted with some fair points.</p>\n<p>For one, users argue that if the locked funds are allowed to be released, the ecosystem would see a lot of affected <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/wallets-ethereum-overview/\" rel=\"noopener\">wallet</a> users demand a similar solution for their hacked, or locked, funds. If a similar occurrence takes place in the future, developer teams would have to work towards recovering the tokens &#8211; which is simply put a complicated process.</p>\n<p>As observed, some users have put forth a selfish reason &#8211; loss of tokens would decrease the supply cap and increase the value of their own tokens.</p>\n<h2>“Rollback,” The Solution To Blockchain Issues?</h2>\n<p>A possible solution for recovering the funds is to “rollback” the blocks to an earlier stage before the hack. While this is a complicated process &#8211; which involves consensus from 51 percent of nodes to agree that the transactions didn’t happen &#8211; it wouldn’t be the first time that the blockchain had been altered to resolve an issue.</p>\n<p>In August 2010, Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik noticed a block that gave an output of 91 billion bitcoin. As <a title=\"\" href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=702755.0\" rel=\"noopener\">stated</a> later by Garzik,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>“In technical language, the bug is known as a number overflow error. So instead of the system counting up 98, 99, 100, 101, for example, it broke at 99 and went to zero (or -100) instead of 100. In layman’s terms, someone found a way to flood the code and create a ridiculously large amount of bitcoin in the process.”</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then in 2016, an Ethereum hard fork was carried out to return ETH valued at $40 million to investors affected by the infamous <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/ethereum-community-considers-solutions-as-hard-fork-debate-rages-on/\" rel=\"noopener\">DAO attack</a>.</p>\n<p>However, such rollbacks and hard forks are possible when the coin is still in its infancy, with the fix not being a complicated procedure.</p>\n', '<p>After a single buggy smart contract in the Parity Ethereum wallet locked-up 600,000 ETH in November 2017, the ongoing GitHub debate raised in the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 999 is heating up.

In truth, even before the crypto was introduced to the market, interest in the project had been high.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In November 2013 the Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin published a white paper on Ethereum, setting out his vision for a programming language that could deliver extraordinary functionality to the blockchain beyond mere currency transactions.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Earlier that year he had travelled to Israel and worked with global investing and trading platform <a href=\"http://partners.etoro.com/aw.aspx?A=64037&amp;Task=Click&amp;TargetURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.etoro.com%2F&amp;SubAffiliateID=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.etoro.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1524761529379000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3pLOLNHTAdiIltyTZ1qjSQ9WDpw\">eToro</a> to develop <a href=\"http://coloredcoins.org/\">Coloured Coins</a>, an open-source banking infrastructure for the future of digital money. It was during this trip that the youngster – who was introduced to Bitcoin, when aged 17, by his father in 2011 –  firmed up his ambition to invent Ethereum.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum, or the ‘Ethereum Virtual Machine’ – which managed to raise almost $20 million in July and August 2014 – was built as a decentralised computer network on top of which software developers could program any platform, and the network is fuelled by ‘Ether’ (or ETH). For many in the cryptocurrency world, the launch of Ethereum was the most exciting development since Bitcoin, the founding crypto, was introduced in 2009.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It did not take long for Ether to be established as the second-biggest in terms of market capitalisation. Ethereum is only behind Bitcoin, the founding crypto that was launched, in that regard. When Ether was introduced, in July 2015, it was valued at $2.8 per token. By March of the following year it had hit $10, and as transactions on the Ethereum blockchain skyrocketed a raft of top organisations begin backing the crypto.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The United Nations, Toyota, Deloitte, Samsung, and many others sought to take advantage of its enormously powerful shared global infrastructure. Before long its price reached $300, and Ether’s value peaked at $1,315 in January 2018.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are many similarities between Ether and Bitcoin. First, they are both blockchain-based cryptocurrencies and can be mined by users around the world. There are some key differences, however. While the annual supply of Ether is limited to 18 million, Ethereum could theoretically continue to introduce new currency and make its supply unlimited. Conversely, Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million – that mark is due to be reached in the year 2140.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another big difference is the processing speed; Bitcoin transactions take around 10 minutes, whereas an Ether transaction takes only 15 seconds.<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Olaf Carlson-Wee, Founder and CEO of Polychain Capital, has predicted that “Ethereum’s price could surpass that of Bitcoin by the end of 2018” and Monkey Capital’s Daniel Mark Harrison reckons it will “likely be valued at over $100,000 by 2042” others are more cautious. Luis Cuende, co-founder of Ethereum-powered company Aragon, says: “Ethereum’s price will hit $1,000 by mid-2019.”<b></b></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a

The coin allows companies and individuals to make use of the transparent exchange of digital currency with essential value that arises from oil.</p>\n<p>Every Aramco coin stands for the worth of a single barrel of crude oil. It will be supported by a stern interest in a bundle of oil assets like Oil Future and Physical Oil plus every interest in all properties used for producing oil. The total value got after adding all interests represents the approximate value of every Aramco coins that are in circulation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aZwcB7Fek\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aZwcB7Fek</a></p>\n<p>ARM as an Investment :<br />\nOne of the key features of using ARM as an investment is the fact that each token is backed by a real barrel of oil. This, as is with other commodity backed cryptocurrencies, means that there is always a base minimum value to the digital asset. An ARM token can never be worth less than the value of the barrel of oil that it represents. According to Aramco Coin, this makes the coin a less volatile investment than free-floating digital currencies and, therefore, a more secure asset.<br />\nAlong with the proposed security of the investment, owning and holding ARM tokens has residual benefits. Aramco is guaranteeing that the price of ARM will increase by at least $0.01 USD every single day for life. That kind of return isn’t life changing money, but it is, at the very least, financial movement in the right direction.</p>\n<p>Trading with ARM :<br />\nWhile holding ARM tokens as an investment is certainly one of the encouraged uses of the Aramco Coin offering, Aramco Coin seems to be more heavily invested in the idea that people will be using the coin to trade on the price of oil. In fact, we have developed a slick online trading platform that will allow ARM owners to trade against the live price of Brent crude on the London Stock Exchange. Traders will pay fees just as all traders do in all markets, but Aramco is putting incentives in place to ease the burden of speculators. These incentives are offered on a sliding scale and allow investors to receive between a 50% and a 90% discount on their fees.</p>\n<p>Aramco (ARM) Initial Coin Offering Details :<br />\nThe Initial Coin Offering (ICO) for the ARM digital coin will begin with 3 stages 1)Pre-sale on April 24th, 2018. The pre-sale will run until May 8th, 2018. The incentive for investors during this time is a 15% bonus on all purchases. 2)Stage-1 sale on May 9th 2018. The Stage-1 sale will run until May 23th 2018. The incentive for investors during this time is a 10% bonus on all purchases. 3)Stage-2 sale on May 24th 2018. The Stage-2 sale will run until June 7th 2018. The incentive for investors during this time is a 5% bonus on all purchases. As ARM is an Ethereum based digital currency, it can be purchased using ETH , BTC and subsequently traded on the Aramco digital trading platform.</p>\n<p>If you would like to get a complete picture of the ARM token and the plans that Aramco has made for the digital trading platform, you can read the ARM white paper or onepager at our website : <a href=\"https://aramcocoin.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://aramcocoin.io</a></p>\n<p>Contact Email Address<br />\n<a href=\"mailto:support@aramcocoin.io\">support@aramcocoin.io</a><br />\nSupporting Link<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.aramcocoin.io/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.aramcocoin.io/en</a></p>\n<p><small><i>This is a paid press release.

Considering this, it is technically possible that NXT is in talks to buy a part of Bitstamp too, and that Nexon Korea is just not involved, but the CEO gave no indication that that is the case.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bitstamp Acquisition Rumors</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-151282\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"$350 Million Bitstamp Acquisition Negotiations Denied by Nexon CEO\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-696x435.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-1392x870.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-1068x668.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bitstamp1-672x420.jpg 672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />Founded in 2011 as a European-focused bitcoin exchange, Bitstamp is considered to be the longest surviving cryptocurrency exchange to date.

Still, just like BTC charts, the 4-hour BCH/USD SMAs have a nice gap between the 100 and 200 SMA trendlines. This indicates the path to resistance should also continue towards the upside, unless BCH bulls get too exhausted. MACd and RSI levels are also heading southbound showing market look oversold and will likely see some improvements. Order books show BCH bulls have some tough resistance to get past the $1,300 region all the way to the $1,375 territory.

The move is seen as a reaction to the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/japans-fsa-suspends-two-cryptocurrency-exchanges-due-to-poor-kyc-aml-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">increased scrutiny</a> of the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) on crypto exchange platforms in the country. By coming together, the participants hope that they would be able to bring sanity to the industry.</p>\n<h2>Checks and Balances</h2>\n<p>Part of the coalition will be to institute checks and balances into the Japanese crypto exchange market. Speaking at the formal launch of the Association, Taizen Okuyama, the chairman of JCEA and the CEO of Money Partners, said that the Association will work hard to improve the security infrastructure of crypto exchange platforms in the country. The JCEA will also create rules and regulations that will guide the activities of these platforms as well.</p>\n<p>According to Okuyama, ensuring compliance will also be a significant part of the Association’s activities. Defaulters of the JCEA regulations will be penalized for undermining the integrity of the market. The JCEA will also look into the fact that some crypto exchange platforms are operating in the country without an FSA license. The Okuyama-led Association will offer help and advisory services to these unregistered platforms so that they can become registered by the FSA.</p>\n<h2>Restoring Public Confidence</h2>\n<p>The <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/largest-theft-crypto-history-half-billion-dollars-worth-nem-stolen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January 2018 Coincheck hack</a> that saw the theft of more than half a billion dollars cast a spotlight on the country’s crypto exchange market. The FSA has had these platforms on a tight leash, even clashing with some established names like Binance. The general perception is that of reduced public confidence in the safety of crypto exchange platforms in the country. The lack public confidence and trust is something that Okuyama is determined to change. Commenting on this issue during the launch, he said that the JCEA would strive to eliminate customer concerns and restore public confidence in the market.</p>\n<p>Apart from Money Partners, the other members of the JCEA are; Xtheta, Bit Argo Exchange Tokyo, SBI Virtual, GMO Coin, BITOCEAN, Tech BURO, Fiscalo Currency Exchange, Bit Trade, BTC Box, DMM Bitcoin, QUOINE, Bitgate, Bit Bank, BitPoint Japan, and bitFlyer. The JCEA is a merger of two separate groups; the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) and the Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA).</p>\n<p>There have been plans since February 2017 to create a body like the JCEA. Yuzo Kano, the executive director of the JBA, said back then that creating a self-regulatory body would take a while to achieve. Apart from Japan, there is also talk of creating self-regulatory bodies for the crypto market in other countries. <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/south-korean-cryptocurrency-exchanges-on-the-verge-of-self-regulation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>BTCManager</i></a> recently reported that stakeholders in South Korea were closing in on crypto self-regulation.

The cybersecurity expert realized something was up when he noticed local complaint portal Reclame Aqui was being flooded with Foxbit-related content.</p>\n<p>Upon digging deeper, he found most users were complaining the funds they had on the platform went missing. Trindade’s<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khWiogTrH0g\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> investigation found</a> that, on Foxbit, users could change their two-factor authentication (2FA) settings using only one password.</p>\n<p>This allowed hackers to phish users, and change their 2FA settings to lock them out of their own accounts.

He sent the company two emails, left a support ticket, and messaged it on Facebook. It took BlinkTrade about two weeks to get back to him. In its response, it reviled it would take seven days to fix the issues.</p>\n<p>Per Portal do Bitcoin, it took the company 25 days to get rid of the vulnerability.

It is worth noting here that the ex-CFTC chairman has been vocal about potential violation of securities laws by coins like ETH and XRP, the second and third most commonly used cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>“The SEC and regulators around the globe need to look at all these tokens,” he said, adding that such a move could bring clarity to the market.</p>\n<p>For the uninitiated, a security is an interchangeable and negotiable financial instrument bearing some sort of economic value. The categorization of crypto coins as securities started gaining ground shortly after the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (<a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SEC</a>) subpoenaed more than 80 firms for information regarding their ICOs in an effort to regulate them.</p>\n<p>Gensler says that both Ether and Ripple, for instance, need to be looked into as the discussion on crypto regulation intensifies. He believes that both these coins have certain traits that make them more like securities instead of currencies.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, if coins like Ether and Ripple are officially recognized as securities, the move could make it illegal for US citizens to trade them on the vast majority of the exchanges they are currently traded. This essentially means that the step will also make it more cumbersome for investors to buy and sell those coins despite their prices.</p>\n<p>Predicting a rather exciting year for the worldwide crypto market, Gensler said that more than 1,000 ICOs and 100+ exchanges would have to get their act together and fall in line with the US securities laws.</p>\n<p>Gensler also said “<a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/?s=Cryptokitties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cryptokitties</a> are not securities,” he explained that they didn’t launch an ICO and it is more like a unique license to own a kitty. </p>\n<h3>Will Bitcoin Be Counted as a Security?</h3>\n<p>According to many industry observers including Gensler himself, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoin</a> is unlikely to be clubbed into the securities category. This distinction comes from the fact that bitcoin, currently the most popular digital currency in the world, did not stem from an initial coin offering or any comparable centralized platform.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the technological aspects of the Bitcoin network are overseen by a decentralized group of developers. Other digital currencies that fall under a similar definition include <a title=\"\" href=\"https://litecoin.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Litecoin</a> and <a title=\"\" href=\"https://getmonero.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monero</a>.</p>\n<p>Gensler has repeatedly stated that Ethereum could potentially face some problems with regulators because the first Ether tokens went to sale (2014) even before the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.ethereum.org/foundation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum Foundation</a> had the network functional.</p>\n', '<p>Gary Gensler, former CFTC chairperson and one of the top financial regulators in the Obama administration talked about the fast evolving realm of cryptocurrencies during his recent speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on April 23, 2018.

Powell pointed out that he would have equally refused the request had it been made from a North Korean attorney as well. The full list of reasons is as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>The deadline of 2 weeks is unreasonable given the scope.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>The publication of the request, lack of any prior communication and inclusion of exchanges which are clearly outside of the AG’s jurisdiction (including Kraken) raise questions about the true motive. It comes off as a publicity stunt.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>The request is ill-prepared. It’s an overly broad fishing expedition that asks questions irrelevant to the stated objective and misses obvious questions that actually would be helpful.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>Much of this information was already provided to the NYDFS in 2014.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>Much of this information was already provided to FinCEN in our 2017 audit.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>Much of this information is publicly available on our website.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>Some of this information is proprietary, trade secret information and kept confidential for competitive reasons.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>Some of this information is highly sensitive and kept confidential for security reasons.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>It is not clear that the complete production can remain private, especially given the government’s recent track record of getting hacked.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p>The AG demands Kraken, which has no NY clients, to assist in protecting NY consumers (presumably against those who have obtained the BitLicense), without offering any sort of compensation for the professional consulting work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pointedly, he added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Kraken is always willing to work with regulators and law enforcement. <strong>Whether you think you have us by the balls or not, approaching us with some basic respect and having a conversation is always going to make the interaction smoother and help you get what you want faster than storming in with your “or else” list of demands.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Kraken on Regulation</h2>\n<p>Powell makes it very clear that he feels personally insulted by the request for suggesting that Kraken was in some way subservient to the NYAG in a way that a non-crypto related company would not be, and stressed that his was a legitimate business and that while scams were rampant in the crypto space, crpyo-specific regulation was not necessary to prevent cases of simple fraud. The SEC has charged a number of ICO founders with fraud recently, the co-founders of the <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/sec-charges-third-partner-in-centra-techs-ico-scheme/\">Centra Tech ICO</a> being a prime example.</p>\n<p>Powell pointed out that he was willing to help the NYAG and US government understand the crypto space and was even willing to do so for free, but seemed to take real offence at what he perceived as an order handed down from what he called an &#8220;ivory tower&#8221;. He stated that customers cared about trading and security, not regulation and &#8220;conforming to Wall St.’s image of what crypto markets should be&#8221;. He has stated on a number of occasions that <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/kraken-chief-investors-need-to-look-out-for-themselves/\">crypto investors need to look out for themselves</a> and perform due diligence when investing.</p>\n<p>His firm stance against the New York AG has divided opinions, but certainly made big waves in the crypto community and may end up prompting other exchanges to re-evaluate their options when it comes to dealing with government authorities.</p>\n<p><em>Featured image from Shutterstock.</em></p>\n', '<p>Kraken CEO and co-founder Jesse made headlines recently for his strongly-worded response to the New York Attorney General&#8217;s request for information on the Kraken exchange, the largest bitcoin exchange based on euro volume in the world.

Software alone will always be less secure and leave you more exposed to hackers.&#8221; The device contains a NFC chip to make wireless transactions and a secure element microcontroller to protect the user&#8217;s private keys.</p>\n<p>While other crypto payment ideas have launched as mobile apps or credit cards, ilmatic delivers an innovative solution by combining contactless payments with various cryptocurrency protocols. The engineering team has been quietly working on connected devices for the last two years and brings experience from the technology research center EURECAT, consumer electronics in Silicon Valley, the LoRaWAN project, and the U.S. Department of Defense. Now, ilmatic looks like the first wearable crypto wallet to arrive in the blockchain space.</p>\n<p>Last year Ledger sold 1 million units of a cold storage hardware wallet that looks like a USB stick. ilmatic delivers similar storage, plus a spending wallet, which may present a more well-rounded product. The company says it will support cryptocurrencies that deliver fast and inexpensive transactions and named Bitcoin on the Lightning Network, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Ripple as possible integrations. The team is also working on its own coin protocol designed specifically for its ilmatic wallet.</p>\n<p>Tamez finished by saying: &#8220;We are making cryptocurrency tangible.

If there is a large backlog of transactions pending in the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/mempool-size\" rel=\"noopener\">mempool</a>, transfer fees and wait times tend to skyrocket. Given that every new transaction must be included in a block of a fixed size, it takes longer to handle the increased load.</p>\n<p>The Lightning Network is <a title=\"\" href=\"https://lightning.network/lightning-network-summary.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">defined</a> as, “A decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that removes the risk of delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties.” It is essentially a second layer, off-chain scaling model that will help speed up bitcoin transactions by taking them off the blockchain. The main chain will only be used to store the net result of all transactions that took place off-chain.</p>\n<h2>Using Bitcoin&#8217;s Lightning Network</h2>\n<p>At first, Todd used <a title=\"\" href=\"https://twitter.com/bitrefill\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitrefill</a>, an online wallet that allows users to pay their utility bills using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Since the transaction was not successful, he tried it again, but this time using <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/acinqs-first-step-toward-lightning-network-for-bitcoin/\" rel=\"noopener\">Acinq’s</a> Eclair wallet. His payment of $48 went through near immediately, and the bill was paid.</p>\n<p>He referred to this improvement as a symbol that the Lightning Network is maturing and could now be opened up to the real world. In time, it should also be able to handle more significant and more complex transactions.</p>\n<p>The Lightning Network opens a peer-to-peer micropayment channel between two transacting parties. Lightning helps in moving payments off the main chain, thus freeing up space for bigger, aggregated transactions on the blockchain.</p>\n<p>Developer Todd paid his bill in three small transactions, each worth $3, $5 and $40. He wrote on Twitter, “Each one worked just as well as the rest.” He broke the payment into three smaller amounts to test the reliability of the Lightning Network.</p>\n<h2>Todd&#8217;s Criticism of Lightning</h2>\n<p>On February 26, 2018, Todd said that he was not sure if it was a good option to use the C programming language for developing and working on the Lightning Network testnet. A testnet is a copy of the blockchain used by developers for testing, without risking the loss of cryptocurrency. He felt that using C would make the whole network susceptible to DDoS attacks among other problems.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Initial impressions of Lightning on testnet: c-lightning segfaults a lot, and when it&#39;s not crashing payments fail more often than not.

Phil Anderson urged the allowance of cryptocurrency donations owing to the increasing adoption made by cryptocurrency in the society.</p>\n<p>Being the chairman of the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.lpwi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wisconsin Libertarian Party</a>, Anderson is running for governor and is a firm advocate of using bitcoin in political affairs.</p>\n<h2><b>&#8220;There are People that Want To Use it as Money for Contributions&#8221; </b></h2>\n<p>Anderson <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article209713659.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">suggests</a> a previously used procedure &#8211; make it a necessary mandate, i.e., required by state policy, to convert bitcoin donations into duly reported dollars immediately. However, the Wisconsin committee voiced two issues, very similar to the generic problems faced by <a title=\"\" href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoin</a>.</p>\n<p>The traditional method of campaign donations via cheque or credit cards allows authorities to trace their source and learn about the donor’s identity. However, bitcoin’s famed pseudonymity makes this impossible, and adding to this is the inherent lack of trust that the government and other regulating bodies place in <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/cryptocyclopedia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptocurrencies</a>. The anonymity of the source isn’t the only hurdle. Of all the cryptocurrencies out there, bitcoin is infamous for its volatility. From its peak near $20,000 in December 2017 to $6,600 in January 2018, bitcoin as a method of donation becomes tough to analyze.</p>\n<p>While the Wisconsin Ethics Commission has taken no immediate action, the attorney general is confident on the county adopting a policy sooner or later.</p>\n<p>In 2014, when the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-price/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">price of bitcoin</a> was around $400, the <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.fec.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Elections Commissions</a> offered the use of the crypto, only as an in-kind contribution. However, certain states are yet to adopt this over the concerns mentioned above.</p>\n<p>While some districts allow digital currencies as means of contributing towards the campaign, a majority of U.S. states are still skeptical about accepting it. For Montana and Washington D.C., it is mandatory for cryptocurrency donations to be converted to USD or used as an in-kind contribution, respectively. On the other hand, regulators in Kansas have rejected the use of bitcoin to fund political campaigns while the state of California has advised against it. </p>\n<h3><b>Upcoming ‘Young’ Government May Accept Crypto</b></h3>\n<p>In March 2018, Austin Petersen, a Republican party candidate from Missouri, <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/bitcoin-donations-fueling-election-campaigns-victory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that he received 24 bitcoins as donations. The donation was the single largest amount received by a political representative via cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Petersen was later evangelizing bitcoin, calling it the modern version of the type of monetary policy that liberty advocates have been proposing for years. At 37 years old, Petersen is younger than most government officials, and the new wave of politicians might be more progressive regarding the acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Petersen added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>“As someone who strongly believes in deregulating money, it was a natural fit for me to accept <a title=\"\" href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bitcoin</a> for my campaign and I’m more than delighted to be the US record holder for the largest donation to a candidate in US history.”</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n', '<p>An emerging use-case of digital assets is to accept campaign donations and political contributions in the form of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.

As it turns out, ICOs can be a great means of raising money, but they are not a new fundraising vehicle that is exempt from the law. For the first half of 2017, ICOs such as Tezos merrily raised funds from U.S. investors under the assumption that their crowdsale was above board because it involved a utility token rather than a security. But as subsequent lawsuits have shown, just because something’s branded as a utility doesn’t make it one.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-96017 size-medium\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"In the Securities Era, ICOs Pleading Ignorance Have No Place to Hide\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-300x300.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-150x150.jpg 150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-768x768.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-696x696.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-1392x1392.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-1068x1068.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action-420x420.jpg 420w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/class-action.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By late last year, the number of ICOs willing to accept U.S. investors had dwindled to a trickle and projects were tripping over themselves to preface every mention of their token with the words “UTILITY” for the avoidance of doubt.

You see public statements. So&#8230;think long and hard and be very deliberate about the public statements you make. You know public companies, for example, pore over their public statements and SEC filings and investor calls&#8230;because they know that after the fact some plaintiff’s lawyer or a regulator&#8230;with the full benefit of 20/20 hindsight is gonna see if something might not be true or might be misleading.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He encouraged anyone considering launching an ICO to be “very thoughtful” about its structure and about “what you say in connection with it”. In one of the lawsuits filed against Tezos, for example the complaint highlights a Reddit AMA that Kathleen Breitman performed in which she referred to herself as a “one-woman band”, a seemingly innocuous statement, which which was later taken to suggest the extent to which she was responsible for what happened with Tezos.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan Moylan observed: “The SEC made a show of going after the bad actors to shock the industry, to make it clear this is not an avenue that won’t be regulated in cases of fraud.” But as Perrie Weiner of DLA Piper noted, just because regulators are watching the space closely shouldn’t be cause for fear. He explained that the SEC don’t want to shut down the entire industry, but simply want “to ferret out the bad apples from the good”.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_151257\" style=\"width: 199px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" wp-image-151257\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Darren_Marble-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"In the Securities Era, ICOs Pleading Ignorance Have No Place to Hide\" width=\"199\" height=\"199\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Darren_Marble-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Darren_Marble-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Darren_Marble.jpeg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 199px) 100vw, 199px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Darren Marble</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crowdfundx’s Darren Marble concluded: “The good news is that US-based blockchain companies have several available options for running a compliant security token offering (STO). Reg D is fast, easy, and efficient, has no cap on the raise, and allows verified accredited investors to invest. Reg A+ allows anyone over 18 globally to invest, has a $50 million cap on the raise, requires audited financials and filing a Form 1-A with the SEC.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the security tokens era, ICOs pleading ignorance have no place to hide. Following the regulatory route may seem arduous, but it’s the only course of action that will allow U.S.-based startups to sleep easy. Given the large sums at stake, the costs of compliance are a drop in the bucket in comparison. Thanks to the added confidence such regulatory approval will give to investors, ICOs may conclude that it’s money well spent.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>Do you think full SEC compliance is the only way to safely launch a token sale in the U.S.? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Images courtesy of Shutterstock and Start Engine.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><i>Need to calculate your bitcoin holdings?

And that the investment would have bought Sequoia almost an 11% stake in the exchange at a valuation of a mere $80 million. Unsurprisingly, as the prices of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies continued to rally, the deal seemed unattractive to CZ and the talks collapsed by the middle of December 2017.</p>\n<p>In fact, by the start of 2018 Binance <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-exchange-disables-new-user-registrations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">claimed</a> to be the largest cryptocurrency trading venue in the world with over 2.9 million users joining the platform since its launch in July of 2017. Based on that incredible growth the exchange was more fairly valued in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. And by December 14, CZ’s people informed Sequoia that Binance’s existing shareholders considered their proposal to undervalue the exchange, as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-25/crypto-billionaire-sued-by-sequoia-after-funding-deal-goes-awry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bloomberg</a> reports.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Talking With IDG Capital on the Side?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-151279\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-300x188.jpg\" alt=\"Binance Exchange Founder Sued by VC Fund Sequoia Capital\" width=\"300\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-300x188.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-768x480.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-696x435.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-1392x870.jpg 1392w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-1068x668.jpg 1068w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Binance-672x420.jpg 672w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />It looks like Sequoia suspects that CZ didn’t reject their offer just because of the soaring valuation mismatch but because he received a competing better proposal. He was allegedly approached by IDG Capital offering two rounds of funding, valuing Binance at $400 million and $1 billion. This was at a time when Sequoia had an exclusivity agreement with CZ.

That\'s because as per bitcoin\'s current rules, only 21 million bitcoin can ever be created.</p>\n<p>Stepping back, the milestone, the first million-bitcoin marker to be crossed <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/charts/total-bitcoins\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">since mid-2016</a>, is perhaps noteworthy as yet another reminder of the technology\'s core computer science achievement - digital scarcity created and enabled by shared software.</p>\n<p>In short, bitcoin\'s code, since cloned and adapted by scores of other upstart cryptocurrencies, ensures that only a set number of new bitcoins are introduced to its economy at intervals. Miners, or those who operate the hardware necessary to track bitcoin\'s transaction set, are rewarded with this scarce data every time they add new entries to the official record.</p>\n<p>Still, there\'s a lot of variability in the process.</p>\n<p>Of note is that it can\'t be precisely predicted when the 17 millionth bitcoin will be mined or who will mine it, due to the many minute variances that are created in keeping a common software in sync. That said, there\'s a relative predictability. Each bitcoin block produces 12.5 new bitcoin, and as bitcoin blocks occur roughly every 10 minutes, about 1,800 new bitcoin are created each day.</p>\n<p>As such, it\'s perhaps best to view this event as a \"psychological barrier,\" Tetras Capital founding partner Alex Sunnarborg told CoinDesk, one that is interpreted differently by different communities.</p>\n<p>Sunnarborg, for example, sought to stress that another way to interpret the result is that 80 percent of all the bitcoin that will be ever created have now been mined. In other words, only about one-fifth of the eventual supply remains for miners and future buyers.</p>\n<p>Others see the milestone as one that\'s ripe for appreciation of the technology and its achievements.</p>\n<p>\"I think it is awesome,\" Tim Draper, the venture capitalist who bought millions of bitcoin seized by the U.S. government at auction in 2014, said of the coming milestone.</p>\n<p>He told CoinDesk:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"I would bet the founders wouldn\'t have imagined how important bitcoin would become in their wildest dreams.\"</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Way with words</h2>\n<p>Others sought to suggest the milestone is one that should be considered as an opportunity for education about both the features of bitcoin, and those of cryptocurrencies broadly.</p>\n<p>For example, unless all of the humans who operate the computers running the bitcoin software decide to make a change (a perhaps unlikely scenario today), there\'s really no way to ever introduce more new bitcoin. This achievement, a technical reality, has played a key role in bitcoin\'s association with money, economics and other scarce, naturally occurring assets.</p>\n<p>In this way, the goldbugs and readers of Austrian economics who piled into bitcoin early on were quick to realize the value of the feature, perhaps giving rise to the term \"cryptocurrency\" itself.</p>\n<p>Trace Meyer, one of this group\'s most vocal members, summed up the philosophy in a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TraceMayer/status/981923803734429700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">tweet</a>, in which he argued governments might seek to prevent users from holding bitcoin in the future.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\"Increasing money supply is a means to confiscate through inflation which is a form of taxation without representation or due process of law,\" he wrote.</p>\n<p>Even the new way new bitcoins come into being, called \"mining,\" is a nod to the gold analogy.</p>\n<p>Rather than being issued by a central bank, bitcoin is created by a network through the work of maintaining the blockchain. When a miner finds a valid hash for recent transactions, solving the bitcoin protocol\'s puzzle, he or she is rewarded with a \"coinbase transaction,\" bitcoin credited to her account.</p>\n<p>A little bit of cryptocurrency is created and deducted from the final supply.</p>\n<h2>The bitcoin supply curve</h2>\n<p>How participants have been rewarded has, of course, changed over time.</p>\n<p>When bitcoin\'s founder Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first bitcoin block on Jan. 3, 2009, he created the first 50 bitcoins. This reward stayed the same for another 209,999 blocks, when the first \"<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/making-sense-bitcoins-halving/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">halvening</a>,\" or reduction in rewards, took place.</p>\n<p>It didn\'t come as a surprise. Every 210,000 blocks, according to a hard-coded schedule, the network reduces the block reward by 50 percent. Following the most recent halvening, in July 2016, the reward is 12.5 bitcoin.</p>\n<p>That means that while there are only 4 million bitcoin left to mine, the network will not reach its final supply in anything like the nine years it\'s taken to get this far. As the halvenings halven, the rate of monetary inflation - supply growth - slows.</p>\n<p>BashCo, a pseudonymous moderator on the r/bitcoin subreddit, has plotted the trajectory of bitcoin\'s total supply (blue curve) against its rate of monetary inflation (orange line).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-327949 size-article-full\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhAQABAPAAAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAEACAkQBADs=\" data-lazy-src=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-728x551.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"551\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-728x551.png 728w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-768x581.png 768w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-155x117.png 155w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-90x68.png 90w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-104x79.png 104w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-344x260.png 344w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-198x150.png 198w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-350x265.png 350w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-419x317.png 419w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-270x204.png 270w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-386x292.png 386w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-264x200.png 264w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-177x134.png 177w\" data-lazy-sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /><noscript><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-327949 size-article-full\" src=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-728x551.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-728x551.png 728w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-768x581.png 768w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-155x117.png 155w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-90x68.png 90w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-104x79.png 104w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-344x260.png 344w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-198x150.png 198w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-350x265.png 350w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-419x317.png 419w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-270x204.png 270w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-386x292.png 386w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-264x200.png 264w, https://media.coindesk.com/uploads/2018/04/bashco-bitcoin-inflation-177x134.png 177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></noscript></p>\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"http://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">BashCo</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Assuming the bitcoin protocol remains the same (a new block is mined every 10 minutes on average and the halving schedule and supply cap are unchanged), the last new bitcoin will not be mined until <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">May 2140</a>.</p>\n<h2>The next 120 years</h2>\n<p>With this in mind, the chart hints at another common talking point when acknowledging the milestone - that bitcoin is programmed to run for a very long time.</p>\n<p>Jameson Lopp, lead infrastructure engineer at wallet provider Casa, was quick to remind CoinDesk that bitcoins are divisible, and that as such, the smallest parts of each bitcoin can hold seemingly infinite value.</p>\n<p>He said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"While 17 million BTC may sound like a lot, it\'s incredibly scarce - there won\'t even be enough for every current millionaire to own a whole bitcoin. Thankfully, each bitcoin is divisible into 100 million satoshis, thus there will always be plenty to go around!\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>But there are other quirks to the software as well.</p>\n<p>For one, bitcoin will never actually reach 21 million units, as barring a protocol change, the total supply will fall short by at least one satoshi. That\'s because on May 17, 2011, the miner \"midnightmagic\" - for reasons that remain unlear - <a href=\"https://blockchain.info/tx/5d80a29be1609db91658b401f85921a86ab4755969729b65257651bb9fd2c10d\" data-wpel-link=\"external\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external noopener noreferrer\">claimed</a> a 49.99999999 block reward, rather than an even 50.</p>\n<p>Further, to be clear, bitcoin does not stop running when 21 million bitcoin are produced. At that point, the idea is that miners would be compensated purely through the fees, which they already collect.

In December, an attack on a 20-year-old student owning cryptocurrency worth millions of rubles became a media sensation. The young man was kidnaped at a subway station. Threatening him with a knife, the attackers took him to his home where they asked for 100 million rubles ($1.6 million) in cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Several days ago, another Moscovite was robbed of 10 million rubles worth of bitcoin ($160,000). In broad daylight he tried to seal a deal with a “buyer” who took his hard wallet and sped off without paying any cash for the cryptos. A week before that, a resident of Nizhny Novgorod lost 800,000 rubles in cryptocurrency ($13,000) under pretty much the same circumstances. Not long ago, a senior citizen in Volgograd was also robbed by crypto crooks.</p>\n<p>The criminal statistics in Russia are full of similar cases. Most of these crimes have been committed during crypto-fiat exchange deals on the street. Many Russians are tempted by these direct sales because online trading platforms take hefty commissions. Usually they involve cash payments and crypto transfers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Rates Starting at Just $15 per Hour</h2>\n<p>The increasing number of thefts and frauds related to offline crypto deals has created a need for a new type of security escort service.

They can be used to tokenize assets, give access to dapps, represent ownership, make holders become active participants of decentralized networks, among many other uses.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to this, digital tokens are creating entirely new economic models which we refer to as token economics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of its novelty, </span><a href=\"https://blog.coinfund.io/cryptoeconomics-is-hard-ad401b2428b9\"><b>token economics can be incredibly difficult</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Cryptocurrencies are often used for multiple features on their related blockchain platform, and each cryptocurrency, or token, is programmed in its own unique way. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understanding the token economics behind cryptocurrencies can assist you with determining which projects are solid, high potential investments and which are not. These models can make or break a cryptocurrency and its related platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this article, we will go through the dynamics of token economics and provide you with several insights to help you understand the token economics behind your next cryptocurrency investment. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Token Economics 101</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Token economics essentially refers to the study, design, and implementation of economic systems based on blockchain technology. Every blockchain platform and blockchain application has its own token economic model. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The subject of token economics focuses on the actual, new economic models that are created through cryptocurrencies. This excludes tokens that are solely used for fundraising and play no significant role in its underlying platform as they do not pose new models. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Securities have been around for a long time and their dynamics </span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp\"><b>are well understood</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even though blockchain and cryptocurrencies allow for a superior way of dealing with securities in terms of transferability and ownership, they do not change the traditional dynamics of securities. Once regulatory frameworks are in place, tokenized, blockchain-based securities will likely be more or less similar to the current system. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrencies allow for so much more than simple fundraising and they make the construction of entirely new business and governance models possible. Token economics is about blockchain models in which the related digital tokens play a pivotal role. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one assumption on which nearly all token economic models are based: </span><b>people act upon incentives</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is based on </span><a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/the-incentive-theory-of-motivation-2795382\"><b>incentive theory</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a human behavioral theory that assumes behavior is motivated by a desire for reinforcement or incentives. In token economics, these incentives are the tokens themselves and they are used to motivate network members to behave to the benefit of the network. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8136\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-8136\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/incentive-theory.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"346\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https://www.thinglink.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Act according to the rules of the network and you’re awarded with cryptocurrencies. So the rules of a network must be set in such a way that people contribute to the entire network because of personal incentives. People want more money and they get more money by doing what’s best for the network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These incentives are mostly financial incentives because tokens have a financial value. This financial value stems from the money that has been invested in specific cryptocurrencies in an ICO and on the crypto exchanges. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Designing the Basics of Token Economies</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Models for token economies are designed and implemented before a new cryptocurrency is launched. The organization behind a cryptocurrency has to decide on the role of their native token on their platform. This is no easy process as any weakness in their model will sooner or later be exploited by someone in the network, so the economic model must be rock solid. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first step of designing models for token economies is choosing the consensus model. However, cryptocurrencies can also be continuously created through several </span><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-consensus-algorithms-d81aae3eb0e3\"><b>consensus algorithms</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For example, <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bitcoin</strong></a> and Ethereum use Proof-of-Work. In this model, you have miners that secure the network and verify transactions by solving blocks. When a miner solves a block, they are rewarded with cryptocurrencies. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other cryptocurrencies such as <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/dash-progress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Dash</strong></a> and NAV coin use the Proof-of-Stake algorithm. In this model, holders of the native cryptocurrency stake their holdings in a wallet to solve blocks. The more tokens you hold, the bigger the chances are that your wallet solves the block and that you’re rewarded with new tokens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In these consensus models, the cryptocurrencies are used as an incentive for participating network members to secure the network, verify transactions, and improve the blockchain ecosystem. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through this, more of the currency come into existence which causes inflation. The supply increases and thus each token becomes worth less, assuming that the demand remains constant. Every consensus model employs its own rules for inflation. For example, for each Bitcoin block solved, the miner receives 12.5 bitcoin. This will be halved somewhere around 2021, after which the reward becomes 6.25 and goes on until all 21 million bitcoins are mined.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8137\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-8137\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/finitesupply.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/finitesupply.png 602w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/finitesupply-200x131.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/finitesupply-600x393.png 600w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/finitesupply-370x242.png 370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: https://www.quora.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This total and limited supply of cryptocurrencies is another key component of the basics of token economics. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To prevent endless inflation, most cryptocurrencies have a finite supply. Through this, the digital coins are scarce and there is no way to create more of it at any point in order to control its price. This measure (of having limited supply) is evident in most cryptocurrencies; it is largely seen as a countermeasure against the current economy in which fiat currencies are endlessly created by the authorities, making the currencies worth less and less, and deteriorating trust in the value of fiat currencies. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Use Cases of Cryptocurrencies in the Network</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a team has decided on the basic model for the creation of cryptocurrencies, they have to create a model for the usage of their token. For transactional coins such as Bitcoin, Dash, and Monero, this model is easy — the cryptocurrencies are a way to transfer value to other parties and to store value digitally. This, however, is by far the most basic use case for cryptocurrencies, something that the rise of Ethereum pointed out. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain and cryptocurrencies allow for decentralized networks — networks that are governed and controlled by its members without a central party — and <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/4-reasons-smart-contracts-will-change-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>smart contracts</strong></a>, which are agreements between parties that are automatically updated and executed. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure that the network of a blockchain or a blockchain application functions effectively and keeps on developing, cryptocurrencies are used. Because there is no central authority, the tokens are essential to the survival and progression of a decentralized platform, and can be used for many different purposes, which include but are not limited to the following uses.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Incentivize Miners</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this model, the cryptocurrency is used to reward miners for securing the network and verifying transactions. How this functions is based on the consensus algorithm in place. The tokens are distributed to those nodes and the fastest miners, making it competitive. Through this competition, more and more people enter the network because they also want a piece of the pie. In turn, this makes the network more secure and allows for faster and cheaper transactions. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Staking</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the PoS and Delegated PoS model, token holders can stake their holdings. Staking is the process of keeping your cryptocurrencies in a private wallet related to the cryptocurrency’s blockchain. This helps secure the network and stabilize the price of a cryptocurrency as less token holders trade these tokens. In return, token holders usually receive rewards. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PoS is a mechanism in which staking individuals have the chance to validate transactions based on the amount of their token holdings. For instance, the PoS model is currently employed by Dash and </span><a href=\"https://oracletimes.com/omisego-omg-vitalik-buterin-says-omg-staking-tokens-are-his-favorite-2018/\"><b>OmiseGo.</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In the Delegated PoS model, which is used by </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/lisk-ascend/\"><b>Lisk </b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrencies-passive-income/\"><b>Ark</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, token holders can vote on delegates that validate transactions for which voters are awarded part of the earnings of the delegates. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Payment of Transaction Fees</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency users that conduct transactions pay a transaction fee. This fee can go to the miners of a blockchain, but also to the entire network. For example, when you send </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-ripple/\"><b>Ripple’s XRP</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to another wallet, a minor percentage of this transaction is burned as a means of payment. This payment is indirectly awarded to the entire network since the supply of XRP is decreased by doing this. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Governance</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the most interesting aspects of token economics as it involves sociology, psychology, networked cooperation, power distribution, and (new) models of democracy.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through token-based governance, network members that hold tokens can vote on the direction of the platform. Developers can propose alterations to the network’s programming, upgrades, new features, and cooperations on which token holders can vote with their token holdings. In this way, token holders are part of the network’s governance process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best example of this is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). This is a fully]-automated, decentralized network that can perform tasks and provide products and services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DigixDAO is such a network that lets their token holders decide on protocol decisions. The amount of holdings determine the weight of someone’s vote. DigixDAO has </span><a href=\"https://globalcoinreport.com/digixdao-dgd-launching-digix-gold-dgx/\"><b>recently launched</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> its </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-stable-coin/\"><b>stablecoin</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> DigixGold, which is pegged to the value of gold. DigixDAO token holders all share the profits of transaction fees of DigixGold. This incentivizes token holders to make informed decisions about the future undertakings of DigixDAO.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Contribute to the Network</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Network participants can also be awarded for contributions to the network without this being automated. Lunyr, for example, is a knowledge-sharing platform on which users can submit articles. These articles are peer-reviewed by other users and both writer and curator receive tokens for their contributions. On the other hand, if a contribution violates the platform’s rules or a curator approves something that is not accepted by other curators, they can get penalized. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to note here is that developers are much more inclined to aid in the development of a platform when they own tokens of that platform, since there is a personal financial stake involved. When the value of the platform increases, so does the value of the holdings of the developer. To increase this effect, the network can distribute tokens to key contributors to increase the personal financial stake involved, incentivizing them to develop the platform even more. </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Blockchain-Based Services</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a token is used for this, a blockchain application’s native token is needed by users to access the application’s product or service. An example is </span><a href=\"https://sia.tech/\"><b>Siacoin</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Siacoin is a decentralized cloud storage platform in which network members with excess digital storage capacity can rent this out to network members that need extra storage. Those that want extra storage pay the providers of storage with Siacoins for this service. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many more applications that use this model, for example Ethereum-based applications such as Augur, Civic, and Golem. As more people start using these blockchain-based products and services, the demand for the native currency will increase, making it more valuable. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Profit-sharing</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some blockchain applications let their token holders share in the profits made by the platform. The token of the cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin, which is called KuCoinShares, entitles holders to 50% of KuCoin’s daily transaction fees. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Iconomi also shares their profits with token holders through recurring buybacks. This means that the Iconomi platform uses portions of their profits to </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-introduces-repayment-programme-54bfa449d458\"><b>buy ICN tokens back</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from the market and burns these tokens, decreasing the overall supply of ICN tokens. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Why Token Economics Matter<br />\n</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important question to ask yourself before buying a cryptocurrency is: what is the purpose of the cryptocurrency I’m buying? The token economics behind a cryptocurrency will guide you towards answering this question. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, there are </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@ryanshea/the-top-rules-for-token-distribution-economics-a0df50530e7f\"><b>several problems with token economics</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One problem is that newly-issued cryptocurrencies are mainly created just to attract (ICO) funds and the actual purpose of the cryptocurrency comes later, if at all. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Second, too much of a network’s tokens are held by investors and the creators instead of by who they are meant for—developers and users of the network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These two problems give an insight as to how to value a cryptocurrency based on its token economics. A platform’s token economy describes how a token will be used on the platform. If a cryptocurrency is only used as a tool for attracting funds, the demand for the crypto will die out over time. Also, if the token is only used for profit-sharing, the token will not be able to compete with tokens that serve multiple purposes and thus have multiple reasons to create demand. A strong demand and valuation derives from the actual usage of a cryptocurrency. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more use cases a token has on its platform, the more it will increase in value as the platform gets used more. Lisk is a solid example of this. The Lisk token, LSK, has various use cases on the platform. LSK is used to pay for transactions, vote for delegates, and is awarded to the top delegates. It is also used to launch applications and sidechains on the Lisk blockchain, and as a base currency to trade native application tokens. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/lisk-platform-explained/\"><b>Lisk ecosystem</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> increases in size and usage, its LSK token will grow in value with it because more people need the token to participate in the ecosystem. The intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies is based on the utility it provides. The more use cases a currency has, the more utilities it serves. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important aspect of token economics is whether the token plays a role in the governance of its platform. In the end, blockchains and blockchain-based applications are meant to be decentralized; to make decisions on a decentralized basis, its users must have a way to let their voices be heard. Through decentralized governance, a platform can move forward by making community-based decisions on upgrades, alterations, and new opportunities. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a more technical analysis on how to assess the value of a utility token, </span><a href=\"https://multicoin.capital/2018/02/13/new-models-utility-tokens/\"><b>click here</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we’re still in the early stages of the blockchain era and most blockchains and blockchain applications aren’t used yet, the question as to whether a coin will actually be used is still highly speculative. A thorough analysis of the token economics behind a cryptocurrency will provide insights on whether there will be a demand for a cryptocurrency in the long term. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are just getting started and already we are seeing an increasing number of different models for token economics. Governance, providing incentives, profit-sharing, access to applications, and contributing to the network are currently the most widely applied token economic models, but there are still numerous ways to utilize tokens in other economic models and these ways are still completely unexplored. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking for your next new cryptocurrency investment, find out what purpose a cryptocurrency serves on its platform. The more sensible use cases a cryptocurrency has, the higher the chances are that the demand for it will increase in the long term. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/long-term-cryptocurrency-investment-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>A Guide to Long-Term Cryptocurrency Investment Strategy</strong></a></p>\n', '<p>It has become clear over the last year that cryptocurrencies can do so much more than replace existing currencies.&hellip;</p>\n', 0, '8135', 'https://www.investinblockchain.com/token-economics/', '2018-04-26 07:42:11', 1),

The statement also included a reference to a transaction conducted by the party behind the Smart Mesh batchOverflow exploit, noting that the Huobi Pro system detected the deposits and did not credit them.</p>\n<h2>What is the BatchOverflow Exploit?</h2>\n<p>The impact of the batchOverflow exploit was first made public by blockchain security startup <a href=\"https://peckshield.com/\">PeckShield</a>, who detected an unusual MESH token transaction on the 25th of April. According to PeckShield, the smart contract used in the exploit possesses a classic integer overflow problem.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_47641\" style=\"width: 1027px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47641\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-proxyOverflow-affected-Smart-Contract.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1027\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-proxyOverflow-affected-Smart-Contract.jpg 1027w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-proxyOverflow-affected-Smart-Contract-300x132.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-proxyOverflow-affected-Smart-Contract-768x338.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-proxyOverflow-affected-Smart-Contract-1024x451.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">A proxyOverflow-affected Smart Contract</figcaption></figure>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://peckshield.com/\">explanation</a> of the exploit provided by PeckShield sheds some light on the above example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“As shown &#8230; both _fee and _value are input parameters which could be controlled by the attacher. If _fee + _value happens to be 0 (the overflow case), the sanity checks in line 206 could be passed. It means the attacker could transfer huge amount of tokens to an address (line 214) with zero balance. Also, a huge amount fee would be transferred to the msg.sender in line 217.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>PeckShield have since provided a full list of ERC20 tokens that are affected by the exploit, which include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MESH</li>\n<li>UGToken</li>\n<li>SMT</li>\n<li>SMART</li>\n<li>MTC</li>\n<li>FirstCoin</li>\n<li>GG Token</li>\n<li>CNY Token</li>\n<li>CNYTokenPLus</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The implications of the exploit on the ERC20 standard are obvious — the Ethereum platform touts the effectiveness of smart contracts as “code is law,” but the fact that there is no traditional security response mechanism in place to prevent these kinds of attacks from occurring is concerning indeed.</p>\n<h2>Market Response</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market, which is currently struggling through a correction of this week’s significant positive momentum shift, has responded negatively to news of the exploit. Smart Mesh token values took a significant hit at the time of the exploit announcement, falling from $0.11 to $0.08 in less than one hour.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_47644\" style=\"width: 665px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-47644\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ETH.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"665\" height=\"301\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ETH.png 665w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ETH-300x136.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ETH 24-hour performance</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ethereum also took a relatively significant hit at the time of the exploit announcement, falling from $664 to $612 over the course of the day as the market absorbed the news.

It has provided users all over the world with unprecedented access to knowledge and communications, but have also put them on their guard against the manipulation of these very benefits. Like all technologies, it is a double-edged sword that is more significant as a moral gauge than as a tool for productivity. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent events might have us scoring low on that gauge. From state-level political scheming to commercial abuse of user data, the internet has been become a potent tool for controlling the masses. Censorship is an equally worrying problem; opposition to net neutrality heralds a world where the government and service providers decide what and how we can do something on the internet. But rather than outright censor the internet, censorship is being used against us to control our minds, a propagandistic tool that is both ideological and economical. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many years, this siege against our freedom has been defended against by active individuals with strong political will. Now, however, with the advent of blockchain technology and projects like </span><a href=\"https://www.skycoin.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Skywire</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we have a technological solution to the dangers and disadvantages of the internet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how did the internet come to this troubling point? Was it not invented with the hope of connecting people all over the world for the betterment of knowledge, understanding and cooperation?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the late 1980s, Tim-Berners Lee, the father of the internet, established the first computer-to-computer connection over the web. It was his research and ideas that laid the foundation for the internet to become a universal communication medium. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In his book </span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Weaving-Web-Original-Ultimate-Destiny/dp/006251587X\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b><i>Weaving the Web</i></b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, he envisions the maturation of the internet differently: </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The web is more a social creation than a technical one. I designed it for a social effect — to help people work together — and not as a technical toy. The ultimate goal of the Web is to support and improve our weblike existence in the world. We clump into families, associations, and companies. We develop trust across the miles and distrust around the corner.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A long time has passed since he gave the world the web. Sadly, Lee’s morals did not seem to accompany the World Wide Web’s explosion to a network populated by billions of users. In that time, the internet has turned from an information repository and an imaginative playground to a fight for our minds. In a way, the growth of the internet reflects our human nature. </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Internet Has Become a Weapon</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following Lee’s establishment of the Internet’s protocols, which we still use today, the internet grew in convenience and capability. We can see a similarity here with cryptocurrencies: the dot-com bubble has parallels with the cryptocurrency market. The potential is talked about endlessly, but the convenience and capability is yet to be fully realized.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the year 2000, the internet transformed from simply a repository of information into the go-to medium on which we could conduct our personal, professional and commercial lives. The vastly increased capabilities of the internet drew in a global audience, and consequently introduced corruption from authoritarian governments, monopolizing tech giants, self-serving advertisers and sociopathic individuals. The war for the individual’s mind had moved from newspapers and television to the online world. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The motivation for bad actors is openly evident. Virtually every part of our lives has a connection to the internet, cornering us in a terrible spot of constant vigilance against misinformation and increasingly sophisticated emotional button-pushing. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The economic incentive for underhanded tactics exist and invite greed. Global political operations, which have always been in operation but until now been limited to the offline world, now execute their agenda over cyberspace. In all of these scenarios, it is us, the public, that suffers the most. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years later, in a blog post, Lee would say:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I invented the web, I didn&#8217;t have to ask anyone&#8217;s permission. Now, hundreds of millions of people are using it freely. I am worried that that is going end in the USA. … Democracy depends on freedom of speech. Freedom of connection, with any application, to any party, is the fundamental social basis of the Internet, and, now, the society based on it.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This war of the internet boils down to a war against our personal rights and choices. In truth, we have always resisted censorship, malicious influence and invasions of privacy on the internet &#8211; the public, valuing the web so much, has used the internet itself to band together and oppose what is an assault on human rights. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the difference is that this time, we can defend our values with another democratic technological revolution: the blockchain. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Blockchain Changes Everything</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are in, what many people call, the second generation of the internet &#8211; “Web 2.0”. This second generation of the internet is an upgrade, with an appealing appearance and ease-of-use, more than just documents of text. It is interactive, collaborative, entertaining and supportive of new endeavors and possibilities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also sinister, deceptive, criminal and materialistic &#8211; a tempting deal with the devil. In exchange for our innermost thoughts and motivations, we are granted whatever pleasures the online world can afford us, which grows in pleasure and material possibility by the day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, the unfair economic and structural model of the internet has brought out the worst in us. The power is squarely in the hand of service providers &#8211; not just ISPs, who control the information we can access and how much we pay for it, but the gateways of the internet that are Google, Facebook, Amazon and others. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concerning content distribution, for example, this latter group takes a disproportionate amount of the revenue related to advertising. The case of the 2016 U.S. elections also showcase how much power social media has in influencing the minds of the people, and how a platform like Facebook can control what millions of people absorb and hold to be the truth.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> With the way power is concentrated in the digital space, those with money and authoritative influence reign supreme and inequality is encouraged. As with land in the feudal era, so is cyber-influence unevenly distributed in the modern age.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we rely completely on our ISPs to gain access to the internet, which works on aging protocols that are extremely vulnerable to snooping, and influenced by those with authority and money. In a time where our data and lives are increasingly online, the stakes of using Web 2.0 become increasingly risky.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain, however, addresses many of the faults of the current web architecture and may usher in the next generation of the internet, “Web 3.0”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/blockchain-beyond-cryptocurrency/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Blockchain technology</strong></a> has the potential to fully realize the original democratic vision for the internet. By its very nature, <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-cryptography/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>blockchain encrypts data</strong></a> on its network and protects it from prying eyes. It removes our reliance on our ISP providers, instead working with our fellow users to support the internet. It takes the idea of connecting people to a very literal level. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mostly importantly, blockchain encourages us &#8211; as individuals citizens and not centralized entities &#8211; to put resources and effort behind that which we think deserve it, and suppress that which goes against our morals. Unlike today’s internet, however, we decide that collectively and truly have a voice in decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is now an realizable hope to build a world where our digital lives are truly our own. It is not just around the corner, but arriving with a gathering speed. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Skywire is Building an Internet We Can Trust</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The internet harbored the spirit of democracy but, for the aforementioned reasons, has lost its way. Decentralization, which also embodies the spirit of democracy, is the necessary base that can facilitate true democracy, from the internet to </span><a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/golem-2018-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>computing power distribution</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, through its removal of centralized entities.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But how can it specifically improve the current situation? What about performance on a decentralized network, which continues to receive criticism? How do we pay for usage?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are the questions that the </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/skycoin/skywire-the-new-internet-for-the-new-world-6d09a8542c50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Skywire project has addressed while building an architecture for “Web 3.0”</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/262964166?app_id=122963\" width=\"1170\" height=\"658\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Skywire Preview\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script></p>\n<h3><b>A Network by the People, for the People</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The net neutrality debate has made it all too clear how much power ISPs have over the content users receive. It is a game of money, with providers holding very little accountability for their actions. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is especially troublesome given the fact that the internet is now an essential utility, like electricity and water supply. Imagine the chaos and injustice if governments were able to dictate who gets either of those resources and how much, and for costs that can constantly be increased and thus put out of reach for some economic classes. This is how net neutrality could affect internet services, and this is why we must create a solution.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have heard of how <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/what-is-bitcoin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Bitcoin</strong></a> eliminates our need to rely on banks for financial transactions; that same decentralization logic can be applied to internet usage, and Skywire intends to do so with the mesh network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mesh network is designed such that users pay, through Skywire’s currency Skycoin, for the amount of bandwidth they consume &#8211; nothing more, nothing less. The price will neither increase, as it does with traditional ISPs, nor will it be subject to a contractual period of any length. You pay based on how much bandwidth you need and consume.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_8200\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-8200\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_-600x539.png\" alt=\"Mesh Network diagram\" width=\"400\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_-600x539.png 600w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_-200x180.png 200w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_-768x690.png 768w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_-370x333.png 370w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_-760x683.png 760w, https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Fully-connected_mesh_network.svg_.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nodes, represented in green, connect directly to, and serve, all other nodes on the network.</figcaption></figure>\n<h3><b>Traffic Protocols for the Modern Age</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Skywire team notes that the TCP/IP protocols don’t fit the decentralized paradigm. Inefficient and weak with regards to security, the TCP/IP protocols have served their purpose as a transitional mechanism towards a more refined and democratic internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As opposed to this outdated protocol, the Skywire project operates on what is called a “mesh network” &#8211; which is just another way of saying that internet traffic is routed through the users of the network. The mesh network is not a new idea, but previously lacked the economic incentive for sustained use. Blockchain technology answers that problem and gives users motivation to help build a new internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The upshot of the mesh network is that there no central point of failure &#8211; should one node go down, the many other nodes still stand to support the internet. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performance benefits are also significant. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skywire utilizes Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) to achieve scalability and performance. While current protocols run through a long chain of IPs before reaching its destination, the mesh network finds the optimal path to the destination, which increases speed while reducing network load. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, the communication protocol used ensures that the data is encrypted and that it is only the sender and receiver who can view the data. It is possible for snoopers to view routed data by piecing individuals packages together &#8211; not so on the Skywire network.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Getting Paid for Participating in a Better Web</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question of why this mesh network should succeed might arise in one’s mind. In previous iterations of the mesh network, user participation has always been an obstacle; this time, Skywire offers economic incentive for users to take part in their network.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Users are incentivized with the native cryptocurrency, Skycoin, to help support the network. A payment protocol is embedded into nodes, allowing them to meter, bill and settle payments for their part in running the network. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skycoin is used to pay for bandwidth. Those who use bandwidth must spend their Skycoins to do so, and those who run nodes, which enables the traffic to be forwarded over the internet, earn coins for doing so. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is Skywire’s counterpart to mining and will be the way that most early users will earn Skycoin. As we mentioned, mesh networks require an economic incentive, fuel to keep the system going, and that’s exactly what Skycoin is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another payment mechanism is Coin Hours, which can be earned by holding Skycoins. Every address that holds a number of Skycoins for an hour earns an equivalent number of Coin Hours. Users can utilize their earned Coin Hours to pay for services on the Skycoin platform. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This system leads to a critical change that is probably not on the minds of many: your data will no longer be sold to third parties. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gone will be the times when you receive targeted advertisements pushing you towards purchases. Tech giants will no longer receive the funding they need to gain an increasingly monopolistic position by selling power to those of their choosing. Your data is your own.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This new economic model for internet usage introduces a fairer, more equal world.</span></p>\n<h3><b>The New Internet Can’t Start Empty &#8211; It Needs Services, Apps and Content</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a system such as this running is an achievement in and of itself, but it stands a good chance of failing as an innovation if it does not meet the requirements of an increasingly digital-savvy society. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is, we cannot expect mass adoption of this new internet if it lacks the things we use the internet for. If services, applications, social media, e-commerce and games did not exist on the internet, we would have very little reason to use it. Unless it meets this ever-expanding base set of needs, a technology will not reach a critical level of adoption. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To that end, Skycoin has been working on a variety of mini-projects, including decentralized applications, a VPN, an encrypted messaging service, a BBS social media platform, cloud storage and a flagship video game. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea is to make the transition from the old web to the new as frictionless as possible &#8212; everything you use the internet for will be available on the new one immediately.</span></p>\n<h2><b>A New Web is Inevitable</b></h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8275\" src=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/internet.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The world is heeding the demands for a better internet. It is time for the web to grow up, and projects like Skywire are leading the parenting lessons, offering more freedom but tempering it with positive or negative reinforcement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blockchain won’t solve all of our problems. Human nature rather dislikes change and the powers that be will certainly run through a decentralized internet with a magnifying glass. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it sets the stage for a more equal digital space &#8211; one that rewards us for the services we want, while asking us to pull our weight in supporting that network. If we cannot trust the government, or any central authority, we must turn to ourselves. We now have reliable platforms that allow us to do so. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is hard not to imagine a future where users participate in a network like Skywire, with its <a href=\"https://www.investinblockchain.com/decentralized-applications-dapps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>decentralized applications</strong></a>, communication features and cloud storage services. The potential here is enormous and the bevy of services indicate that they are serious about creating a comprehensive solution that will indeed enable the Skywire network to act as replacement for the current model of the internet.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time will tell how it will play out, but we can be assured that blockchain has not had its final say in influencing the internet. We are being given the tools we need to help create the internet we want. The rest is up to us.</span></p>\n<p>To learn more about Skywire and Skycoin, visit their <strong>website</strong>.

Yet as it stands, they use a hodgepodge of data structures and formats to track the life cycle of trades, reflecting in part the variety of regulatory requirements imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, without a common language, there\'s not much to be gained from having a common ledger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the financial world\'s blockchain evangelists are pinning their hopes on a broader industry effort to harmonize the way data is presented and reported, regardless of the platform used. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Known as the common domain model (CDM), it was proposed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) in May of last year and has the support of blockchain tech startups such as R3 and Axoni.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But perhaps the biggest champion of CDM as the key to making blockchain a reality in the derivatives space is Barclays.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The U.K.-based bank recently set up an internal CDM adoption working group, and will be presenting its vision for how smart contracts can be combined with the concept Thursday at ISDA\'s annual meeting in Miami, Florida. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\'s a pivotal time for the project, as ISDA is expected to release the first iteration of the blockchain-compatible version of CDM early this summer</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunil Challa from the business architect team at Barclays was emphatic about hitting the reset button.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"There is a shiny new technology promising to be a panacea for fixing many post-trade processing issues. So, now is an opportune moment to re-engineer our processes,\" Challa told CoinDesk, adding:</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Simply replicating the existing fragmented state would be a colossal missed opportunity.\"</span></p></blockquote>\n<h2>A common tongue</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stepping back, Barclays has played a central role in the convergence of DLT, smart contracts and common data standards. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two years ago the bank showcased a prototype of how smart contracts could be used throughout the lifecycle of a derivatives trade, including negotiating an ISDA master agreement, entering individual trades and performing the trades on a distributed ledger. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the concept has caught on, the standards challenge remains in the way of adoption, according to Dr. Lee Braine, a member of the investment bank CTO Office at Barclays. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the one hand, distributed ledger platforms are now reaching acceptance by some of the most systemically important market infrastructure incumbents, Braine said. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"But what we haven\'t yet seen is adoption of common standards by the industry,\" he said. \"What we ultimately need in the derivatives space is multiple market infrastructures, including multiple clearing houses, adopting a common standard for data formats, reference data, transactional data, and business processes.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\'s where Barclays and others believe the CDM comes in. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, banks have worked to standardize the format of messages between them, but kept their own idiosyncratic ways of communicating data internally - like a country with a national language but numerous local dialects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, as Braine pointed out, the CDM and DLT share a common goal in going further and standardizing data within institutions. (Speaking the national language at home, as it were.) </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this way, the CDM could provide an alternative route for addressing the looming challenge of interoperability between different blockchain platforms. At present you often hear industry participants talk about being \"blockchain-agnostic\" because it\'s too risky to bet on just one platform provider.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To illustrate this point, Braine described a future scenario in which banks are trading with each other on different distributed ledgers. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are some counterparties on one network and other counterparties on other networks, then does that mean you would need to host a node on every network? Or are they going to be genuinely interoperable?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"A simplistic solution would be to revert to the traditional model of silos with messaging between them, but that risks replicating the fragmentation of the past,\" said Braine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"If you instead transition to the CDM, then at least there is opportunity to standardize on data structures, lifecycle events etc.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if that isn\'t persuasive enough, Barclays estimates significant cost savings to the derivatives market. Its working group projected around 25 percent efficiency gains from adopting CDM just in the clearing space, and around $2.5 billion in annual run costs.</span></p>\n<h2>Regtech rising</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Barclays isn\'t alone among financial in advocating for the CDM, of course. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goldman Sachs is also a supporter, and sees the common data standard, when combined with shared ledgers, as a way to alleviate some of the pressure created by the increased reporting requirements under regulations like the European Union\'s MiFID 2. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ayaz Haji, the technical architect for the MiFID 2 program at Goldman Sachs, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">said a common representation of product terms and lifecycle events should not only reduce inconsistencies but also provide a platform for further efficiencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The investment bank won\'t rule out alternatives to blockchain in adopting the standard, however.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Those who are closest to the CDM project recognize that a persistent shared implementation such as DLT would be the most optimal way to use the model,\" said Haji. \"That said we are also open minded about potential implementations and look forward to vendor feedback to the version of the model which is due to be published by ISDA shortly.\"</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Less equivocal than Goldman, Barclays is making a forceful case for using DLT in conjunction with the common standard.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, Braine also pointed out a way that a common data standard could amplify another benefit of blockchain. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commonly pitched use case for the tech is the streamlining of regulatory reporting - the regulator can operate a node on the blockchain and pull data directly from it. The U.K.\'s Financial Conduct Authority has already tried this out, participating in a proof-of-concept for regulatory reporting of mortgage transaction data using R3\'s Corda platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The problem is that in the current world, banks have their main trading data, and their risk models basically duplicate that and perform a simulation.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"If we were able to use a common domain model, we would be able to use exactly that same data. We wouldn\'t need to write two versions of what\'s going on, one just for the risk model,\" said Braine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, though, reaching common standards, like implementing blockchains, is a team sport, and the game is still far from won.  </span></p>\n<p>Clive Ansell, head of market infrastructure and technology at ISDA, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"There is a fantastic opportunity ... but the level of success will depend on the industry operating to a common data and processing model.\"</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/barclays-bank-sign-logo-high-street-1062402458?src=0AtWf5sSjil1H_XUAHAl5w-1-13\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Barclays</a> image via Shutterstock.</em></p>\n', '<p>U.K.-based bank Barclays is pushing hard for a data standard for derivatives, as a foundation for that market to adopt distributed ledger technology.</p>\n', 0, '327916', 'https://www.coindesk.com/barclays-goldman-champion-isda-standard-blockchain-derivatives/', '2018-04-26 08:36:45', 1);

Establishing an orderbook for a particular cryptocurrency or token can be complex and expensive and local exchanges consider the verification process extremely seriously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to sources, the listing of Zcash and Qtum on Bithumb took several months of market research and analysis before its development team decided to integrate the two tokens.

Each time, the hash value from the preceding dataset is stored in the following one. The hash value is a computer-technology term used in the area of cryptography and denotes an alphanumeric value. The unique feature of this mathematical function is that it depicts a string of characters of any desired length on a string of characters with a fixed length.

The leading cryptocurrency is the first viable candidate to replace <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-vs-oil-and-gold-there-is-a-difference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">gold</a> according to John Pfeffer, hedge fund manager at Pfeffer Capital. Bitcoin could rise to no less than $90,000 in the next couple of years, and potentially as high as $700,000, Pfeffer predicted during the annual event.</p>\n<p>“We should think of crypto assets as a venture capital investment. They can go to 0, but there is a chance that they could be worth much more. In the case of bitcoin, it would be worth $90,000 if it became equal to private gold bullion holdings, about $1.6 trillion of total value compared to $150 billion or thereabouts today. It’s a bet, it’s a risk that I’ll be willing to take”, the investor told <em>CNBC</em>.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Using a Yellow Metal in a Spacefaring Society</h2>\n<p>“On the higher end – you could get to higher values, if bitcoin becomes a major reserve currency, i.e. if countries begin to take bitcoin in their reserves. In that case, it can reach several hundred thousand dollars,” John Pfeffer added. In order for that to happen, bitcoin will have to replace about 25% of foreign reserves. Currently they are at $12.7 trillion in total, 11% of which is gold, and about 60% of the rest is the US dollar. Other currencies, like the euro, the British pound, the Swiss franc, and the yen make up the rest.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-151842 size-full\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pfeffer.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Big Money Wears Big Horns, Claws Are In the Closet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pfeffer.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pfeffer-300x173.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pfeffer-768x442.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pfeffer-696x401.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pfeffer-729x420.jpg 729w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>“When I think about the displacement argument, I start with gold. It’s kind of silly – we are a spacefaring, digital society and we’re still using a yellow metal as our non-sovereign store of value. At some point we’re going to come up with a better technology for that and bitcoin is the first candidate. We’ll see if it works,” Pfeffer said. In his opinion, there are some advantages to having a non-fiat-based reserve currency for many countries that would see other countries as strategic rivals.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Circle Doubles Minimum Bitcoin Trade Size</h2>\n<p><img class=\"alignright wp-image-151845 size-medium\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Big Money Wears Big Horns, Claws Are In the Closet\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-300x225.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-768x576.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-80x60.jpg 80w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-160x120.jpg 160w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-696x522.jpg 696w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle-560x420.jpg 560w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Circle.jpg 863w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" />One of the largest liquidity providers of digital assets and cryptocurrency has reported a rising activity, despite the decline in crypto trading volumes across retail exchanges. Circle Trade, the trading operation of Goldman Sachs-backed <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/circle-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-to-improve-service-at-poloniex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Circle</a>, has increased its minimum ticket size on bitcoin trades.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s chief executive, told <em>Business Insider</em> that the size of block trades made by Circle Trade has grown significantly since the start of this year. He also said that the company has doubled the size of its minimum crypto trades from $250,000 to $500,000 USD.</p>\n<p>“The minimum ticket size has moved up to $500,000 with an average of $1 million dollars,” Allaire said noting that some transactions are even larger than $100 million. “That watermark will continue to rise,” he predicted.</p>\n<p>Circle, which has recently expanded its operations in Asia, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, trades more than $2 billion in cryptocurrency a month. It also intends to bring its business to other new markets. Circle has acquired the crypto exchange <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/poloniex-now-requires-legacy-trading-accounts-to-verify-identity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Poloniex</a> and is also planning to add a number of coins and enable fiat-to-crypto transactions.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">OTC Trading Helping Growth</h2>\n<p>Platforms like Circle provide high-net-worth crypto-holders and institutions with an opportunity to make large transactions. They are an alternative to crypto exchanges like <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-to-reopen-the-gdax-bitcoin-casheuro-order-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GDAX</a> and <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/kraken-ceo-condemns-hostile-questionnaire-issued-new-york-ag/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kraken</a>, boasting better liquidity to support such trades. OTC (over-the-counter) trading has helped the growth of many trading platforms without impacting the broader market.</p>\n<p>The average trade size of another cryptocurrency trading shop, Genesis, has also increased – to about $300,000 dollars, <em>Business Insider</em> reported, quoting an unnamed source familiar with its operations. Genesis trades $1billion-2 billion USD a month. DRW&#8217;s Cumberland and Kraken are also operating similar trading desks.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">CBOE Lowers Bitcoin Futures Prices</h2>\n<p>Aiming to achieve a positive impact on the XBT futures market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange wants to lower the minimum increment on its futures contracts – from 10 points to 5 points, where 1 point is worth 1 US dollar. In a letter to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (<a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-regulator-cftc-chairman-takes-funding-cuts-incredibly-personally/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CFTC</a>), the managing director of <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/cboe-bitcoin-contracts-slide-36-percent-as-january-futures-expire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CBOE</a> Future Exchange, Matthew McFarland, wrote about an amendment that would allow the change.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-151850 size-full\" src=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CBOE.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin in Brief Thursday: Big Money Wears Big Horns, Claws Are In the Closet\" width=\"1000\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CBOE.jpg 1000w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CBOE-300x97.jpg 300w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CBOE-768x247.jpg 768w, https://news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CBOE-696x224.jpg 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>McFarland believes that this would be beneficial to the public and market participants in general. The amendment would affect only transactions involving one contract, and not spread trades which have a minimum increment of 0.01 points, or $0.01. The executive also said the decision to make the change, likely to come into effect in May, was supported by data collected since the launch of CBOE bitcoin futures contracts in December.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Do you think the expectations of serious investors are indicative of a positive future for bitcoin?

The result is a massive transfer of wealth from ordinary families to internet promoters.” Although bitcoin continues a far more respectable climb above $9,000 this week, something of a poster child for the cryptocurrency arena whose overall market cap recently surged $100 billion to $425 billion overall, Harris sees nothing but woe ahead.  </p>\n<p>Writing in an article for <em><a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/24/17275202/bitcoin-scam-cryptocurrency-mining-pump-dump-fraud-ico-value\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Recode</a></em>, the founder of Personal Capital Corp and former CEO of PayPal, Harris went on to explain why he dislikes <a title=\"\" href=\"http://bitcoin.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bitcoin</a>. Refuting all given reasons enthusiasts and promoters claim the coin has value, he also repudiated it’s core ability as a currency, pointing out that almost no one accepted bitcoin as payment in the world. Harris refuted all of the positive reasons enthusiasts and promoters forward in the coin’s defense. Labeling its supposed value as a classic case of Greater Fool Theory, he said that the coin’s volatility made it completely unsuitable as a store of value and that “Cryptocurrency is best-suited for one use: criminal activity.”</p>\n<p>Harris made mention of <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/us-claims-north-korea-responsible-wannacry-bitcoin-ransomware-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WannaCry</a> and Silk Road ransomware and their exploitation of the cryptocurrency arena.</p>\n<h2>Harris is Concerned About People Investing Money They Should not</h2>\n<p>“All of this would be a comic sideshow,” Harris said, “if innocent people weren’t at risk.”</p>\n<p>Korean regulators, especially, have made the news due to their concern around the elderly in that country investing their pensions in cryptocurrencies to try and leverage wealth. “But ordinary people are investing some of their life savings in cryptocurrency,” Harris opined, something he sees as having nothing but a negative consequence as a result.</p>\n<p>He called on regulators the world over and the SEC, in particular, to take hold of the situation and clamp down.

Thiel, like many investors, sees Bitcoin as a viable digital replacement for gold.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, PayPal itself has <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/paypal-files-patent-improve-cryptocurrency-transaction-times/\">patented a Bitcoin wallet</a> intended to reduce both the time and cost it takes to execute transactions, though it is unclear whether the company will build out this idea into a functional product.</p>\n<p>The op-ed goes on to make several other tired claims, and Harris repeatedly conflates Bitcoin with initial coin offerings (ICOs).</p>\n<blockquote><p>“In what rational universe could someone simply issue electronic scrip — or just announce that they intend to and create, out of the blue, billions of dollars of value?,” he writes, referencing <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/money-pit-telegram-ico-hits-1-7-billion-after-2nd-funding-round/\">Telegram</a>’s $1.7 billion ICO. “It makes no sense.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>That may or may not be a valid criticism of ICOs &#8212; indeed, many within the cryptocurrency community have levied similar arguments &#8212; but it has little to do with Bitcoin. Nevertheless, he repeatedly harps upon ICO fraud and other related criticisms as though they reflect on Bitcoin itself.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“All of this would be a comic sideshow if innocent people weren’t at risk. But ordinary people are investing some of their life savings in cryptocurrency. One stock brokerage is encouraging its customers to purchase bitcoin for their retirement accounts!,” he says, referencing <a href=\"https://www.ccn.com/robinhood-takes-more-turf-expands-into-colorado/\">Robinhood</a> &#8212; which does not actually offer retirement accounts.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The horror.</p>\n<p>I wonder if anyone has told him that two regulated exchanges have listed Bitcoin futures contracts &#8212; or that numerous Wall Street firms actively working to list the first Bitcoin ETF.</p>\n<p>Now that I think about it, perhaps a better title for this article would have been “<a href=\"https://www.clublaura.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/simpons-old-man-yells-at-bitcoin-1.jpg\">Old Man Yells at Bitcoin</a>.”</p>\n<p><em>Featured image from Youtube/<a class=\"yt-simple-endpoint style-scope yt-formatted-string\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwY9B5_8QDGP8niZhBtTh8w\">TWiT Netcast Network</a>.</em></p>\n', '<p>One could say that former PayPal chief executive Bill Harris is not fond of Bitcoin, but that would be an understatement.

However, developer Cody Burns has offered a proposal that would change Ethereum Classic’s underlying algorithm to accommodate the new technology.</p>\n<p>If this change is accepted, ETC will become one of the first major cryptocurrencies to level out the playing field and accommodating both  GPU mining and ASIC-based mining, which forms a significant threat toward keeping up a competitive and sustainable environment for miners of a particular blockchain.</p>\n<p>The fear of <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/tag/asic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ASICs</a> disrupting the balance of major cryptocurrencies is not on baseless grounds. In the opinion of some crypto enthusiasts, an ASIC-based disruption is an inevitable event based on historical data.</p>\n<p>As per developers, the only way to fix the rising threat from ASICs is to update the software itself, such that it resists this type of mining. In April 2018, Monero&#8217;s developers <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/moneros-scheduled-upgrade-to-soon-reveal-the-extent-of-secretive-asic-mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">famously asked</a> all users to upgrade their nodes, wallets, and miners in an update that would resist ASIC mining.</p>\n<p>Also, Burns <a title=\"\" href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/war-miners-not-2-billion-blockchain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">believes</a> that “the only path to increase competition in the ASIC manufacturing space and keep away from centralization is by allowing ASICs to run rampant.”</p>\n<p><a title=\"\" href=\"https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/91\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Accessible</a> on GitHub under the Ethereum Classic proposal (<a title=\"\" href=\"https://github.com/ethereumproject/ECIPs/pull/91\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ECIP-1043</a>) the mechanism describes an algorithm which creates random variances in the code’s memory, to combat against powerful ASICs dominating the network.</p>\n<h2>Update May Bring Back GPU Mining</h2>\n<p>Although the idea seems far-fetched, Burns is positive about it gaining support. If the system is implemented, several benefits are in store for traditional GPU-based <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mining</a>. For one, the updated mechanism decreases the need for vast amounts of computing memory &#8211; as it eliminates the DAG function &#8211; hence making it possible to GPU miners to remain profitable.</p>\n<p>The DAG function causes ETC miners to store randomly produced acyclic graphs of data packets, which are stored as a proof-of-work in blocks. </p>\n<p>According to Burns:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>&#8220;The thinking behind it was, it is costly to add RAM to an ASIC so we will keep the RAM requirement a moving target. Anyone developing an ASIC will be creating equipment that will become obsolete very quickly.&#8221;</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DAGs have grown over time &#8211; ETC’s DAG is now 2.5GB from 1GB &#8211; and would only grow further as the blockchain length increases. Consequently, ETC miners requires better hardware each year, which consume large amounts of electricity and are expensive to buy, and dissuade individual or hobbyist miners from keeping the network running due to lack of rewards.</p>\n<p>The proposal states, “As evident by <a title=\"\" href=\"https://btcmanager.com/everything-you-must-know-about-bitmains-asic-miner-for-ethereum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ASICs being developed</a> that are capable of matching current GPU miners while being more energy efficient, the DAG has failed at its task and now only serves as a deterrent to broader investment in application specific hardware by competent distributors.”</p>\n<h2>ASIC Miners Make Blockchains Centralized</h2>\n<p>Initially meant to hosted only on developer computers, the bitcoin blockchain has experienced a move from graphic card mining to full-fledged, expensive ASIC miners.

Soon afterwards, my parents took me home, and I still haven’t been able to return to school.”</p>\n<p>Yue’s open letter went viral after being posted on popular Chinese online platforms WeChat and Weibo.

While Harris may be ill-informed when it comes to the reasons behind his anti-Bitcoin stance, the issues the PayPal founder highlights during his recent teardown of Bitcoin are worth addressing, if only for how frequently they are brought up by cryptocurrency opponents.</p>\n<h2>Why Bill Harris is Wrong</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_47670\" style=\"width: 186px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"wp-image-47670\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/harris-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"186\" height=\"186\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/harris-300x300.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/harris-150x150.jpg 150w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/harris.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 186px) 100vw, 186px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Founding PayPal CEO, Bill Harris</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Harris brings up a number of different reasons as to why he believes that investing in Bitcoin is sure to result in the loss of all investor capital, focusing on three primary points that don&#8217;t specifically address Bitcoin but are rather aimed at cryptocurrencies in general.</p>\n<p>Harris states that according to promoters, cryptocurrency is valuable as a means of payment, as a store of value, and as a “thing in itself.” And according to Harris, none of these things are true.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin, which can currently be used as a currency at hundreds of thousands of stores and businesses around the world including Microsoft, KFC, Playboy, Subway, massive retail electronics giant Bitflyer, as well as online retailer Overstock, is experiencing rapid adoption. It’s now possible to use Bitcoin to pay for holidays via Expedia, purchase virtually anything via ecommerce platform Shopify, or even travel to space with Virgin Galactic.</p>\n<p>Harris, however, states that “Bitcoins are accepted almost nowhere,” and that the volatility of Bitcoin makes it “useless as a means of payment.”</p>\n<p>The second point highlighted by Harris is that Bitcoin is useless as a store of value as its extreme price volatility makes the cryptocurrency an undesirable store of value. An ideal store of value will be immune to inflation and will ideally appreciate in value.</p>\n<h3>A store of value is anything that retains purchasing power into the future — how much purchasing power does one BTC purchased for $0.08 in 2010 now retain?</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_22116\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-22116\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-store-of-value-facebook-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin – Storer of Value\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-store-of-value-facebook-300x158.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-store-of-value-facebook-768x403.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-store-of-value-facebook-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bitcoin-store-of-value-facebook.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Related Story: <a title=\"Bitcoin – Storer of Value\" href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-storer-value/\">Bitcoin – Storer of Value</a></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Harris even contradicts his own statements regarding the effectiveness of Bitcoin as a payment method when stating that the primary use of Bitcoin is as a payment method that circumvents law enforcement, stating that its “use is dominated by illegal endeavors.” If Bitcoin is such an inefficient payment method, then why would it be “best-suited for one use: Criminal activity”?</p>\n<p>The last point of contention presented by Harris is perhaps the most interesting. Harris argues that “a Bitcoin has no intrinsic value” and refers to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory\">greater fool theory</a>, stating that Bitcoin is driven by the irrational beliefs and expectations of market participants.</p>\n<p>To follow Harris’ logic, the US dollar has no intrinsic value either. Consider the definition of US currency, taken from the US Treasury website:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold, silver or any other commodity, and receive no backing by anything This has been the case since 1933. The notes have no value for themselves, but for what they will buy.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Bitcoin is only worth what it will buy. According to the free market, Bitcoin is worth <a href=\"https://www.bitgild.com/\">gold</a>, <a href=\"http://bitcoin-realestate.com/\">real estate</a>, and luxury vehicles. Harris argues that some cryptocurrencies, such as randomly-selected token Sweatcoin, serve no purpose than to be used as frequent flyer points or online coupons, stating that there is no need for complex encryption in this case.</p>\n<h2>Bill Harris Has the Facts Wrong</h2>\n<p>The last point highlights exactly what Harris doesn’t get about cryptocurrencies — decentralization. There are, in fact, several cryptocurrencies that aim to replace customer reward points, or “frequent flyer” points, and their main purpose isn’t encryption, but decentralization and interoperability.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies focus not on creating a new currency or one that can be better used by criminals to avoid the law, but instead on putting the power of value control back in the hands of those who hold it. Bitcoin allows individuals to “become their own bank,” controlling the way the value represented by their currency is stored, managed, and transferred.</p>\n<p>Decentralization isn’t the only element of blockchain technology that flies far above the head of Bill Harris. According to Harris, mining Bitcoin is “stealing” Bitcoin:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hackers are getting into the act.

We believe blockchain was approximately 10% of AMD revenue in [the first quarter of] 2018,\" chief financial officer said Devinder Kumar during an earnings call on Wednesday after AMD revealed that it made $1.65 billion in first-quarter revenue, a 40% increase year-over-year.</p>\n<p>Kumar noted that the combined gaming and blockchain demand contributed to a 95% boost year-over-year for its GPU and computing markets. That said, Kumar indicated that the company believes that it will see a \"modest decline in graphics [revenue] due to blockchain.\"</p>\n<p>All in all, AMD anticipates less than 10% of its 2018 revenue will come from cryptocurrency miners.</p>\n<p>\"Based on the strength of our business momentum, for the full year 2018, we now expect revenue to increase by mid-20s[%] over 2017, driven by the ramp of our new products. Blockchain revenue to be mid to high-single-digit percentage of revenue for 2018,\" he said during the call.</p>\n<p>Looking past the figures, however, CEO Lisa Su struck a somewhat optimistic tone for AMD\'s prospects in the blockchain infrastructure sector.</p>\n<p>She remarked:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"I do think the blockchain infrastructure is here to stay. I think there are numerous currencies. There are numerous applications that are using the blockchain technology. We don\'t see a significant risk of secondhand GPUs coming into the market. I think what you find is that, one, there are number of different currencies, and, two, a lot of these users that are buying GPUs these days are actually buying them for multiple use cases, both commercial and consumer.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"They\'re not necessarily buying just for mining,\" Su continued. \"I think, most people are comparing sort of this blockchain time period to the last one which was a couple of years ago and I think there are a couple of important differences. I think the first one is that there are multiple currencies and multiple applications that are being used. And what we\'ve seen is that people who are mining do go from one currency to another depending on what\'s happening.\"</p>\n<p>The only unknown factor at play involves retail sales, as Su said it was \"hard to tell\" whether retail sales go toward gamers or miners. But even there, AMD believes it has a close approximation of the demand.</p>\n<p>\"I think the breadth of the blockchain applications and also the breadth of the customer base give us that belief,\" she later concluded.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><i><a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/cryptocurrency-mining-craze-cryptocoin-minining-software-1019767675?src=krCJGhRWUV1gMcmG__b-xA-1-45\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener external noreferrer\" data-wpel-link=\"external\">Cryptocurrency mining screen image</a> via Shutterstock</i></p>\n', '<p>While AMD sees demand for GPUs to process blockchains falling this quarter, CEO Lisa Su believes the technology will have a long-term impact.</p>\n', 0, '328075', 'https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-mining-made-up-10-of-amds-revenue-in-q1/', '2018-04-26 18:36:45', 1),
